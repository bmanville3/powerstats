# Overview of [`models`](../models/) Graph Directory

The graphs under [`./test_set/`](./test_set/) are graphs generated by testing the corresponding models on the true test data. That is, the data of users that were actually drug tested and either passed (0) or failed (1). There were 111 failing users and 111 passing users exactly used to generate these graphs.

The graphs under [`./val_set/`](./val_set/) are graphs generated by testing the corresponding models on the validation split data. The data was randomly split 80/20 from the training data and filtered to be exactly 50% users who did not compete in a drug tested competition (1) and users who did compete in a drug tested competition (0).

The graphs under [`./train_loss/`](./train_loss/) are graphs generated by plotting the loss of the training and validation data during training.
