The lifter's performance shows notable progression over a relatively short timeframe.

1. **Performance Progression**:
   - From December 2022 to April 2023, their total lifted weight increased from 455.0 kg to 505.0 kg, an increase of 50.0 kg in just 4 months, which is considerable given the lifter's young age and relatively low bodyweight.
   - Subsequently, from April 2023 to October 2023, they improved further from 505.0 kg to 522.5 kg, gaining an additional 17.5 kg over 6 months.

2. **Age and Weight Class Consideration**:
   - At 21.5 years and a bodyweight of approximately 60 kg, the lifter is competing in a relatively low weight class, where improvements can be harder to achieve due to the limits of muscle mass gain.
   - The consistency in performance improvements, especially in the squat and deadlift, raises eyebrows, especially since the increases in figures (both relative and absolute) are considerable for someone in their weight class.

3. **Rate of Improvement**:
   - The initial gain of 50 kg over 4 months is particularly striking as such rapid improvements often suggest the potential for the use of performance-enhancing substances, especially in younger athletes who may not have reached their natural potential.

**Conclusion**: While it is not definitive proof of drug use, the combination of significant total weight increases, the weight class considerations, and the age of the lifter within the context of typical performance trends raises suspicions. Therefore, I would assess a likelihood of drug use at 7/10.
