The lifter's performance shows a notable progression in total weight lifted over the years. Starting at 625.0 kg in 2014, their totals increased consistently, reaching 710.0 kg by 2019. This represents a total increase of 85.0 kg over five years, averaging approximately 17 kg per year—an admirable but not uncommon improvement for a dedicated lifter.

However, it is essential to consider the lifter's age and body weight. The lifetime progression appears reasonably steady, especially given the lifter's advancing age (from 52.5 to 57.5 years). Additionally, their bodyweight has increased from around 103.2 kg to 119.3 kg. Weight gain can contribute to performance improvements in powerlifting, but an increase of approximately 16 kg in body weight alongside a total lift increase of 85 kg may suggest an exceptional benefit from heightened muscle mass and strength.

The lifter's performance metrics, particularly the squat and deadlift lifts, also show significant improvements, notably reaching a deadlift of 257.5 kg, which can be considered high for their bodyweight range. While these improvements reflect excellent training and dedication, they raise questions about the rate at which these advances occurred, especially given that the lifter is not a novice but rather has been competing for several years.

In conclusion, while the performance gains are impressive, the combination of increasing body weight, age, and relatively rapid totals makes this lifter's progression somewhat suspicious. Given the context of competitive powerlifting and common performance-enhancing practices, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 6/10.
