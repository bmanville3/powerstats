The lifter appears to be a young male at the age of 18.5, weighing 85.55 kg and achieving a total lift of approximately 183.7 kg. Their squat, bench press, and deadlift are all equal at 61.2 kg, indicating a balanced performance across the three lifts.

While the absolute total of 183.7 kg may seem moderate for a well-trained athlete in this weight class, the lifter's age and bodyweight raise some flags. At such a young age, the lifter has demonstrated a substantial total lift, suggesting they may have considerable training experience or be exceptionally gifted.

However, without historical data on their performance progression over time, it is challenging to determine the rate of improvement accurately. Rapid advancements in strength, particularly from a young lifter, are not uncommon but can sometimes hint at unsanctioned aids.

Given these factors, while the performance is impressive for a lifter of this age and weight, there's no clear evidence of an unnatural enhancement in the data provided, though the lack of context (such as prior performance metrics) complicates the assessment.

Taking all this into consideration, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a moderate 4/10.
