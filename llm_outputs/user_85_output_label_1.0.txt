### Performance Analysis

The lifter in question, at 22.5 years of age and weighing approximately 104.8 kg, achieved a total lift of 715.0 kg, with individual lifts of 277.5 kg in the squat, 170.0 kg in the bench press, and 267.5 kg in the deadlift. This performance indicates a solid competitive level, although not elite, especially for a male lifter in the 100+ kg weight class.

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Total Lift**: 715 kg is a competitive but not extraordinary total for this weight class. Elite lifters often exceed 800 kg.
   - **Lift Distribution**: The squat and deadlift numbers are notably higher, while the bench press is relatively low compared to those lifts. This discrepancy can be common but could also indicate a specific training focus.

2. **Relative Performance**:
   - The total lift of 715 kg represents a strong performance for someone of this age and bodyweight. However, without a timeline of previous performances to compare against, it's difficult to assess the rate of improvement accurately.

3. **Suspicion of Drug Use**:
   - **Rate of Improvement**: If this performance is significantly higher than previous totals without a reasonable timeline, it may raise suspicion. A rapid increase in lifting totals, especially at a young age, can be indicative of performance-enhancing substance use.
   - **Absolute Performance**: While the total itself isn't extraordinary, it is substantial enough to warrant scrutiny, especially if previous totals were significantly lower.

Given that the available data lacks historical context to evaluate the rate of performance improvement effectively, and considering the lifter’s age and relative totals, there is a moderate suspicion but not overwhelming evidence of drug use.

### Conclusion
The lifter's performance is strong, but without evidence of an extreme rate of increase or exceptionally high totals compared to peers, the likelihood of them using performance-enhancing drugs appears moderate.

**Rating: 4/10**
