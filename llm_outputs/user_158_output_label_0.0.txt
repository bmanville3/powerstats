The lifter in question shows a noteworthy progression in total lifting performance from 242.5kg in March 2017 to 385.0kg in March 2025. This increase of 142.5kg over approximately eight years reflects significant improvement, though it's essential to consider the context of age and weight class.

1. **Age and Weight Class:** The lifter started at age 14.5 with a bodyweight of 65.4kg, and by age 15.5, they weighed 56.95kg. This is an unusual trend; typically, as athletes grow, their bodyweight may increase, which often allows for better performance due to increased muscle mass. The drop in bodyweight coupled with increased performance raises a red flag.

2. **Performance Increase:** The total lift increase from 242.5kg to 372.5kg in 2024 (a 130kg increase in just over seven years) and then to 385.0kg in 2025 indicates a rapid improvement, particularly when considering the relatively small weight increase and the young age of the athlete.

3. **Benchmarks and Comparison:** The lifter’s combined lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift) have increased significantly. For a young athlete, such improvements are possible but usually require years of dedicated training and often align with natural growth.

4. **Suspicion of Drug Use:** While impressive, the rate of performance increase is somewhat concerning, especially given the lifter's drop in bodyweight and the relatively high total lift compared to age and experience level. This raises the likelihood of potential performance-enhancing drug use.

Based on these observations, I would assess the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10, indicating a significant concern for potential drug use given the rapid increase in performance coupled with decreasing bodyweight.
