The lifter's performance shows a significant improvement from the first recorded total of 380.0 kg in February 2020 to 507.5 kg by May 2021, an increase of 127.5 kg in just over a year. This rate of progression is notable, especially considering the lifter's young age of 16.5 at the start, which typically indicates a period of natural growth and development. The bodyweight also increased from approximately 92.85 kg to 102.85 kg, suggesting the lifter gained 10 kg during this time, which could contribute to increased lifting capacity.

However, the increase in total lifted weight appears disproportionate to the gain in bodyweight, particularly in the squat (140 kg to 200 kg) and deadlift (145 kg to 200 kg), indicating rapid strength development that may not be typical for a lifter of this age and experience level. The improvements in bench press (95 kg to 107.5 kg) are less dramatic, but the overall total increase raises some concerns.

Given the substantial gains in strength within a relatively short timeframe, coupled with the lifter's young age and the absolute performance levels achieved, there is a reasonable suspicion of potential drug use. While it's possible that natural talent and training contributed to this progress, the overall statistics suggest that the lifter may be utilizing performance-enhancing substances.
