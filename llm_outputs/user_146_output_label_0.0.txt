The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over time. Starting with a total lift of 577.5 kg in August 2022, they decreased slightly to 565.0 kg in November 2022, before making a significant jump to 595.0 kg in April 2023. This represents a 17.5 kg increase in total lift within approximately five months, which is a substantial improvement for a lifter who is already competing at a relatively high level in the 74 kg weight class.

The lifter's squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers (S/B/D) have also shown improvement, particularly the squat and deadlift, which both increased significantly. Their age (28.5 years) is relatively young for a serious powerlifter, which can contribute to the potential for continued improvement, but the rapid increase in total lift raises concerns.

Given the combination of the significant increase in performance over a short period of time, coupled with an already impressive total lift for their weight class, there are indications that the lifter might be using performance-enhancing drugs. While it's important to consider natural variations in performance, the abrupt rise in their total suggests that monitoring could be warranted.

Rating: 7/10
