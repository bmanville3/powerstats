The data shows a progressive increase in the lifter's total weight lifted over time, with a notable rise from 492.5 kg in February 2021 to 660.0 kg in December 2023. This represents an increase of 167.5 kg (approximately 34% increase) over nearly three years, which is significant, especially considering the lifter's relatively young age and the duration of their training.

Examining the individual lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift), the lifter's performance also demonstrates a consistent upward trend, with substantial improvements in each category. For instance, the squat increased from 167.5 kg to 237.5 kg, the bench from 117.5 kg to 165.0 kg, and the deadlift from 207.5 kg to 257.5 kg, indicating substantial development in strength.

While some lifters may naturally progress as they gain experience and strength, the rate of improvement observed here—especially in conjunction with the increase in bodyweight from 65.2 kg to 80.3 kg—can raise suspicions. The lifter has gained about 15 kg while significantly boosting their total lift weight, which is atypical for natural athletes without the use of performance-enhancing substances.

Considering the overall performance metrics, rate of improvement, and the lifter's age, there is a reasonable basis for concern regarding the possibility of drug use. However, without additional context (training regime, competition history, etc.), it's challenging to conclude definitively.

I would rate the likelihood of them using performance-enhancing drugs as 8/10.
