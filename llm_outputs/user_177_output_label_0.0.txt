The lifter, at just 19.5 years old, has achieved a total lift of 487.5 kg, with specific lifts of 170.0 kg in the squat, 117.5 kg in the bench press, and 200.0 kg in the deadlift. Given their bodyweight of approximately 59.5 kg, they are lifting significantly above the expected norms for their weight class, particularly in the squat and deadlift.

Typically, junior lifters (under 20 years old) may not reach such levels of performance without extensive training and physiological development. The substantial totals at a young age, combined with the rate at which they appear to have progressed in their lifts, raise questions about the legitimacy of their performance. A rapid progression in strength alongside high totals for a light bodyweight can often indicate potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Considering these factors—age, bodyweight relative to lift totals, and the potential for accelerated performance growth—I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10.
