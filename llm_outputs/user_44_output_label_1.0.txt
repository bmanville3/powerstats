The lifter in question exhibits a notable progression in total lifted weight over the years.

1. **Performance Progression**:
   - The total weight lifted has increased from 245.0 kg in December 2014 to 372.5 kg in October 2018, marking a total increase of 127.5 kg over approximately four years. This represents an average annual increase of about 31.9 kg, which is significant but not out of the realm of possibility for a dedicated lifter.
   - Particularly striking is the increase from 305.0 kg to 372.5 kg between May 2017 and October 2018, a gain of 67.5 kg in just 17 months. Such a rapid improvement may raise questions regarding the natural limits of performance enhancement.

2. **Consistency**:
   - The lifter also exhibits consistency in their performance, with several entries showing a total lift of 305.0 kg on two occasions and steady improvements thereafter.

3. **Bodyweight Considerations**:
   - The lifter's bodyweight has increased from approximately 64.3 kg to 71.4 kg during this period, which suggests that the lifter may be moving to a higher weight class. This is a common practice that allows athletes to lift heavier weights, but it also varies the risk of performance-enhancing drug use.

4. **Rate of Improvement**:
   - The rate of improvement appears unusually fast after May 2017, especially considering the lifter's advancing age (from 52 to 54 years old). Such rapid gains at this age are rare among natural athletes.

In conclusion, while the lifter's consistent performance and gradual weight class increase may suggest a serious and dedicated training regime, the significant leaps in performance raise suspicions of potential drug use. Given the sharp increase in total weight lifted alongside the age factor, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 8/10.
