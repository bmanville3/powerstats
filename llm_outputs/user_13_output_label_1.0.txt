The lifter's performance shows a steady increase in total lifted weight over time, demonstrating consistent improvement. The significant milestones include:

- **2018-01-27:** Total 642.5kg at age 22.5, bodyweight 104.2kg
- **2019-01-26:** Total 617.5kg at age 23.5, bodyweight 103.8kg (a minor drop in total)
- **2019-06-22:** Total back up to 642.5kg at same age but slightly heavier
- **2020-07-11:** Reached 662.5kg, a notable increase
- **2021-07-10:** Jump to 710.0kg, with a significant rise in bodyweight to 117.6kg
- **2022-02-19:** Total slightly decreased to 697.5kg with a bodyweight drop
- **2022-07-23:** Again, an increase to 712.5kg, but bodyweight stabilized around 109.3kg

The lifter has consistently improved over several years, particularly with a notable leap from 662.5kg to 710.0kg in a single year, which is a substantial increase (47.5kg). Additionally, the bodyweight increased significantly around the time of this performance jump, which raises flags regarding weight management and muscle mass gain.

While increases in strength can occur naturally, the rate of progression—especially in the context of the increased bodyweight alongside performance gains—might suggest possible performance-enhancing drug use. The improved totals coupled with relatively modest bodyweight changes and significant performance jumps lead to a more suspicious view of potential drug use.

Taking these factors into account, I would estimate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at **7/10**.
