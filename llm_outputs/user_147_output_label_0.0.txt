The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over the years. Starting at a total weight of 667.5 kg in November 2015 at age 17.5, the lifter achieved their highest total of 740.0 kg by November 2018, representing an increase of 72.5 kg in three years, averaging about 24 kg per year. This rate of improvement, particularly in a lifter who is relatively young and still developing physically, raises some concern.

Analyzing the specific lifts, the squat (S), bench press (B), and deadlift (D) totals also indicate significant growth, with the deadlift showing a particularly impressive increase from 282.5 kg to 305.0 kg. The lifter consistently maintained a body weight around 118.5 kg while achieving these lifting totals, which suggests a stable performance without drastic weight fluctuation, often associated with drug use.

However, the overall performance increase, especially considering the lifter's age and the relative short time frame, suggests a rapid enhancement that could be indicative of performance-enhancing drug use. While there is no direct evidence of substance use, the progression pattern and impressive totals compared to the lifter's age raises a red flag.

Given these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 6/10.
