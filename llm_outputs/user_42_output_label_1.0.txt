The lifter's performance shows a notable progression from a total of 482.5 kg in December 2016 to a peak of 642.5 kg in June 2022. This represents an increase of 160 kg over approximately 5.5 years. While this growth is substantial, it is not exceedingly rapid given the age and physical development of the lifter, who started at age 18 and progressed to age 24 during this timeframe.

Analyzing the specific lifts (S/B/D), the lifter has consistently improved across each discipline, culminating in impressive absolute performance numbers, particularly in the deadlift, which peaked at 255 kg. The lifter also maintained a stable bodyweight around the mid-60 kg range, showing discipline in weight management, which is commendable in powerlifting.

However, the lifter experienced periods of regression, most notably in early 2019, where there was a decrease in total weight lifted, followed by a recovery to higher totals. This fluctuation may suggest normal training cycles rather than a consistent upward trajectory.

In terms of suspicious behavior regarding possible drug use, while the gains are significant, they fall within a reasonable range for a dedicated athlete. The consistency of performance, coupled with the lack of extreme spikes in totals or drastic changes in bodyweight, indicates no overt red flags.

Overall, while the lifter has achieved impressive totals for their bodyweight and age, there is no compelling evidence to suggest the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Likelihood of drug use: 3/10.
