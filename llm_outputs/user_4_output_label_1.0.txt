The lifter exhibits a progressive improvement in total lift performance over the years, starting from 602.5 kg in April 2016 and reaching a peak of 707.5 kg in April 2022. The increase in total lift weight shows an overall gain of 105 kg over approximately six years, which averages out to roughly 17.5 kg per year.

When breaking down the individual lifts (Squat/Bench/Deadlift), the lifter improved from 212.5/135.0/255.0 kg to 262.5/172.5/285.0 kg, showcasing consistent growth across all three disciplines. Notably, the lifter's bodyweight fluctuated modestly, increasing from 73.25 kg to 82.05 kg during this period, suggesting that their performance gains, while significant, are not disproportionally high compared to their bodyweight.

However, the rate of increase in total lift and the lifter's performance in their mid-to-late twenties (averaging nearly 20 kg per year) raises questions. This rapid progression could indicate the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs, especially when considering the absence of steady increases and fluctuations in bodyweight during peaks in performance.

Considering these factors, the lifter's performance trajectory does not necessarily exhibit red flags on its own; however, the relatively fast rate of improvement combined with the lifter's increasing age does warrant scrutiny.

On a scale of 1-10, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at **6/10**.
