The lifter's performance shows a significant and consistent improvement over a relatively short period.

1. **Performance Progression**:
   - From December 2014 to December 2016, the total lifted increased from 592.5kg to 637.5kg, an improvement of 45kg in two years.
   - From December 2016 to April 2017, the total lifted rose again to 682.5kg, adding another 45kg in just four months.

2. **Age and Development**:
   - The lifter progressed from 18.5 to 21.5 years old during this timeframe, which is a critical growth period for strength development. However, the rate of increase, particularly during the latter part of this period, raises some concern.

3. **Bodyweight and Performance**:
   - The lifter maintained a bodyweight around 97.4kg, with no significant weight fluctuations noted, indicating they are competing efficiently within their weight category.

4. **Relative Improvement**:
   - The increases in squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers are sharp, especially the deadlift, which jumped from 227.5kg to 265.0kg in just one year. The substantial leap in just a few months (from 265.0kg to 275.0kg) also raises flags.

5. **Suspicion of Drug Use**:
   - While rapid development can occur naturally, the combination of high absolute performance with such a steep upward trajectory, particularly in a relatively short timespan, is often a characteristic associated with performance-enhancing drug use.

Considering these factors, the high improvement rate combined with strong absolute performance raises the likelihood of drug use. Therefore, I would rate this lifter's likelihood of using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10.
