The data indicates a significant decline in the lifter's overall performance over the years. In 2014, the lifter achieved a total of 510.5 kg at the age of 58, with a solid breakdown of their squat (S), bench press (B), and deadlift (D) as 122.5 kg, 183.0 kg, and 205.0 kg, respectively. By 2015, while still competitive, the total dropped to 492.5 kg, and the lifter's age increased to 59. This slight decline is expected as lifters age, but the subsequent drop to a total of just 340.5 kg in 2020 while at the age of 64 indicates a drastic decrease in performance, particularly in the deadlift where their weight lifted fell significantly.

Overall, the lifter's performance trajectory reflects a natural decline due to aging, and there are no observable signs of sudden spikes in performance that might suggest drug use. The numbers do not appear excessively high for a male lifter in this age category, and the progression shows a typical decline rather than an anomalous increase.

Considering the performance trend, the absence of remarkable increases in total lift, and the age-related decline, the likelihood of drug use appears low.
