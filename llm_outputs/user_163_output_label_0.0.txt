The lifter in question has a total lift of 555.0 kg across the squat, bench press, and deadlift with individual lifts of 205.0 kg in the squat, 120.0 kg in the bench press, and 230.0 kg in the deadlift. At 22 years old and weighing 98.35 kg, these numbers indicate a relatively strong performance, particularly in the deadlift category where the lift is significantly above average for his weight class.

Given the substantial total lift and age, it's pivotal to examine the progression of the lifter's performance over time. If this total or individual lifts have increased significantly in a short duration, it could indicate either a remarkable natural progression or potential use of performance-enhancing substances. However, without historical data illustrating the lifter's previous performances, we can't definitively assess the rate of progression. The combination of strength, relatively low age, and high performance raises some flags, especially if the lifter has moved up quickly through weight classes or gained substantial strength over a short period.

While absolute performances can vary widely and numerous factors contribute to lifting strength (training, nutrition, genetics), the combination of younger age and high lifting totals does suggest a closer examination is warranted. Without additional data indicating rapid progression, the suspicion remains moderate.

Considering the above points, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 6/10, as the performance is impressive, but not conclusively indicative of drug use without further historical context.
