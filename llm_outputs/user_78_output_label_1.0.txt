The lifter's performance shows a notable upward trajectory over the recorded periods. Starting with a total lift of 400.0 kg in May 2021, improvements are seen in each subsequent measurement, culminating in a total lift of 447.5 kg by March 2023. This reflects a consistent increase of 47.5 kg over nearly two years, which indicates significant progress.

Notably, the lifter has also adjusted their body weight throughout this period, experiencing a drop from 91.7 kg to 87.2 kg, while still improving their total lift. This suggests effective weight management alongside strength progression, which can be typical in youth lifters as they transition through puberty.

However, considering the lifter's age (14.5 to 16.5 years), the amount of total lifting achieved at such a young age, particularly for a female lifter, raises some questions. The peak total of 447.5 kg is substantially high for this demographic, which may lead to concerns regarding the legitimacy of the performance enhancement methods used.

Overall, while the lifter shows an impressive development, the combination of rapid progression in strength and high total lift for their age and gender may suggest a likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use. I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 7/10.
