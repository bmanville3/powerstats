**Analysis of Lifters Performance Over Time:**

The lifter, a 20.5-year-old female, has consistently recorded a total lift of 437.5 kg across three entries. Over the span of approximately five months between the first and second entries, there was a slight improvement in the squat (from 155.0 kg to 157.5 kg) and deadlift (from 167.5 kg to 172.5 kg), while the bench press saw a drop (from 115.0 kg to 107.5 kg). However, retaining the same total while adjusting individual lifts indicates stability rather than marked improvement.

The lifter's bodyweight decreased from 84.0 kg to 81.48 kg, which is a notable shift but not unprecedented in the context of powerlifting. Considering her age and the nature of the sport, these lifts, although commendable, are not excessively high for an experienced female lifter.

There is no overwhelming evidence of suspicious behavior based on the data alone. The relatively minor adjustments in performance and bodyweight suggest a typical training cycle rather than dramatic enhancements.

Based on the consistent performance and age-appropriate totals, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at **3/10**.
