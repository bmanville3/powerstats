The lifter in question demonstrates a notable improvement in performance over a relatively short period.

1. **Performance Gains**:
   - From June 1, 2024, to September 28, 2024, the lifter increased their total from 345.0 kg to 422.5 kg, a gain of 77.5 kg in just over three months (approximately 25.8 kg per month).
   - From September 28, 2024, to March 20, 2025, there was a further increase to 460.0 kg, adding another 37.5 kg over roughly six months (approximately 6.25 kg per month).

2. **Age and Development**:
   - The lifter started at age 15.5 and is now 16.5, a time of significant physiological development. While youth athletes can experience rapid improvements, particularly during growth spurts, the initial large jump raises some concern.

3. **Bodyweight Considerations**:
   - The lifter's bodyweight increased from approximately 50.7 kg to 55.2 kg over this period, which could suggest they are gaining weight in relation to their lifting totals. However, the total weight lifted is disproportionately high compared to the weight class they are competing in.

4. **Absolute Performance Context**:
   - By the age of 16.5, achieving a total of 460.0 kg is impressive but raises flags when considering the rapid progression. Young lifters typically progress, but the initial jump from 345 kg to 422.5 kg is unusually steep, especially in a short period of only three months.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the rapid performance increase, particularly the first significant jump, and the competitive totals relative to his age and bodyweight, there are grounds for suspicion regarding drug use. While natural development can account for some improvements, the scale of progress appears atypical.
