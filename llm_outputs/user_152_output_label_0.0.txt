The lifter in question shows a notable improvement in their performance over the span of one year, with an increase from a total lift of 265.0 kg to 287.5 kg. This represents an increase of 22.5 kg, or approximately 8.5%, in just one year.

Analyzing the individual lifts, the squat has increased from 95.0 kg to 110.0 kg (an increase of 15 kg), the bench press has decreased slightly from 50.0 kg to 52.5 kg (an increase of 2.5 kg), and the deadlift has risen from 120.0 kg to 125.0 kg (an increase of 5 kg). The squat improvement is particularly significant, suggesting either exceptional training progress or potential assistance.

At 17.5 years of age, while the lifter is still relatively young, the progress made in the squat raises some concerns regarding the rate of enhancement. Given that the total lift is approaching 290 kg, which is competitive even in higher weight classes for female lifters, it could be seen as unusually high for an athlete of this age, sex, and bodyweight.

Overall, the combination of a rapid increase in strength, especially in the squat, along with the lifter being on the younger side raises flags for potential drug use. Based on the data presented, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
