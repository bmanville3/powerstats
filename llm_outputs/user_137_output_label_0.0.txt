The lifter in question has demonstrated a consistent upward trend in total lifting performance over a relatively short period. Starting with a total of 330.0 kg in July 2021, the lifter achieved significant improvements, culminating in a total of 432.5 kg by November 2023. This represents an increase of 102.5 kg over approximately 27 months, averaging a gain of nearly 3.8 kg per month.

In analyzing performance metrics, the lifter's squat, bench press, and deadlift totals have all increased substantially. From the initial records, the lifter increased from 112.5/77.5/140.0 kg to 167.5/92.5/172.5 kg in their respective lifts, showing remarkable improvements in all three lifts. This consistent escalation of performance may raise questions regarding the rate of improvement, especially given their relatively young age and consistent low bodyweight.

The lifter has shown increases of around 45 kg in total from 2021 to 2022, and another 32.5 kg from 2022 to 2023, indicating a substantial performance trajectory. While improvements are not uncommon in powerlifting, such progression can sometimes be indicative of enhanced training methods or, unfortunately, the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).

Considering the lifter's rapid improvement along with their overall totals, the performance may appear suspicious. With the combination of young age, notable progression, and the nature of the sport, this raises the likelihood of PED use.

On a scale from 1 to 10, I would assess the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10.
