The lifter in question has demonstrated notable improvement over a span of approximately 16 months. The total lifted weight increased from 600.0 kg to 622.5 kg, indicating a gain of 22.5 kg, which translates to an average increase of 1.41 kg per month. Furthermore, the individual’s squat improved from 215.0 kg to 227.5 kg, bench press from 135.0 kg to 150.0 kg, and deadlift from 250.0 kg to 245.0 kg.

While these gains may not seem extraordinary on the surface, it is important to consider the context of the lifter's age and competitive weight class. A 1.41 kg monthly increase is significant for a lifter already at a high level. Additionally, the lifter's bodyweight remained relatively stable, suggesting that their improvements are not due to an increase in mass.

In assessing the potential for performance-enhancing drug use, several factors come into play. The improvement in lifts, particularly in the squat and bench press, appears to be consistent yet aggressive, especially for an experienced lifter in a competitive category. The relative increase in performance without a corresponding increase in bodyweight raises a flag, as it may suggest enhanced recovery or strength gains that are atypical in natural athletes.

Considering the data and context, it appears that the lifter's rate of improvement could be seen as suspicious. The combination of significant performance gains in a short period, the relatively stable bodyweight, and the competitive nature of the sport raises concerns.

Overall, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
