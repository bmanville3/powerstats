The lifter's performance data shows a progression in total lift weight across several competitions. Starting with a total lift of 595.0 kg on January 28, 2023, the athlete saw a marginal increase to 600.0 kg by April 8, 2023. However, a drop in performance occurred on October 28, 2023, with a total lift of 577.5 kg, before rebounding to 597.5 kg on February 1, 2025. The bodyweight remained relatively stable, with slightly varying values in the 79.7-81.0 kg range.

The lifter has achieved impressive absolute performance metrics, particularly given their age of 19.5 to 21.5 years. The lifts, particularly in the squat and deadlift, show a notable increase over a short period, especially when comparing the best lifts of 260.0 kg and 265.0 kg in the deadlift category. This performance improvement, which includes increases in all lifts, generally exceeds expected natural progression for an athlete in this age group with only minor fluctuations in bodyweight.

While the lifter's performance is commendable, the rapid progress and high absolute performance levels raise some concerns regarding the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. Given the consistency of their lifts and the overall improvements observed, while still accounting for age and physical condition, it leans towards the higher end of suspicion.

Considering all factors, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10.
