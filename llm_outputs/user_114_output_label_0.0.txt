The lifter's performance shows a notable improvement over the recorded competitions. From a total lift of 522.5 kg on September 10, 2022, the lifter progressed to 590.0 kg by March 23, 2024. This represents an increase of 67.5 kg over approximately 1.5 years.

Breaking this down further:
- **Progression in lifts**: From 522.5 kg to 590.0 kg, the lifter increased their total by about 12.9% over 18 months.
- **Individual lifts**: Notably, the lifter recorded substantial increases in squat (from 180.0 kg to 212.5 kg), bench press (from 107.5 kg to 117.5 kg), and deadlift (from 235.0 kg to 260.0 kg), which indicates balanced improvement across all lifts.

While the lifts are commendable, the rate of improvement—especially during the transition from 555.0 kg to 590.0 kg—seems relatively steep given the lifter's age and prior performance levels. Typically, a 12.9% increase in total lift weights over 18 months for an experienced lifter (considering that they are already at a fairly high level) raises some concerns.

Furthermore, the bodyweight of the lifter increased from 75.0 kg to 81.1 kg, which suggests an approximate increase of 6.1 kg in body weight alongside the gains in lifting capacity. This could indicate a potential muscle mass increase; however, such a rapid weight gain, coupled with significant performance gain, can be indicative of potential substance use.

In summary, the lifter's progressive improvement is impressive but raises red flags in terms of rapid increase in performance levels relative to their competitive history, particularly considering the relatively short time frame.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the likelihood of using performance-enhancing drugs at **7/10**.
