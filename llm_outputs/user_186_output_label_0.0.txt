The lifter in this data entry has achieved a total lift of 325.0 kg at a bodyweight of 57.25 kg, translating to a very impressive total-to-bodyweight ratio. The distribution of lifts—squat (120.0 kg), bench press (65.0 kg), and deadlift (140.0 kg)—indicates a balanced performance across the three disciplines.

Considering the lifter's age of 26.5 years and the total lifted, it's notable that elite performance in powerlifting can often be achieved at this age, but the combination of relative light bodyweight and high total lift strengthens concern. The lifter's current performance level is exceptional for their weight class, suggesting potential for rapid advancement. Such rapid improvement can sometimes be indicative of drug use, particularly if the lifter has shown significant gains in a short timeframe without prior competitive history available for comparison.

Overall, while individual performance levels can be achieved naturally, the combination of high total weight relative to bodyweight, a relatively small age group of competitive lifters, and the potential for rapid progression raises flags regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Likelihood of drug use: 7/10
