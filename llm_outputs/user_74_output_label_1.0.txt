The performance analysis of the lifter shows a notable progression from 2019 to 2022. Over this period, the lifter increased their total lifted weight from 560.0 kg to 627.5 kg, which represents a total gain of 67.5 kg in just under three years. This equates to an average gain of approximately 22.5 kg per year, which is significant but not unprecedented in competitive powerlifting, especially for someone in their early to mid-20s.

When examining the individual lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift), there is a steady improvement across all three lifts as well. The lifter displayed consistent gains in their squat, bench press, and deadlift, with particularly notable jumps in their squat and deadlift numbers. The increase in body weight from 88.0 kg to 97.8 kg also suggests a move to a higher weight class, which can sometimes offer advantages in strength given the increase in muscle mass.

However, the rate of performance improvement, particularly the nearly 70 kg increase in total lift within a three-year span, may raise some eyebrows. While such progress is achievable, it is on the higher end of acceptable gains for a natural athlete, especially considering that the lifter is already competing at a high level.

Additionally, while the total performance is impressive, it stays within the realm of competitive limits for lifters in this age and weight category, suggesting that extraordinary performance isn't out of the question but could be seen as suspicious.

Considering the rapid improvements and the overall totals, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 5/10. This rating reflects a balance between their notable progress and the potential for natural development, albeit with some caution regarding the speed of their performance increases.
