The lifter's performance shows significant improvement from an initial total lift of 492.5 kg in 2017 to a peak of 682.5 kg in 2023, representing an increase of 190 kg over six years. Notably, the lifter’s age has increased from 35.5 to 42.0 during this period, which typically correlates with decreased performance in strength sports, particularly for lifters over age 40.

The data also reflects consistent and substantial increases in individual lifts across all three categories (squat, bench press, and deadlift). The progression from a total lift of 492.5 kg to 640.5 kg in 2022 and a further increase to 682.5 kg in 2023 suggests an aggressive improvement trajectory. The lifter's performance in terms of absolute weights lifted, particularly achieving a total of 682.5 kg at bodyweights around 73-74 kg, appears notably high given their age.

Additionally, the rapid improvement over the last few years, particularly the jump from 640.5 kg to 682.5 kg in just about a year, raises some suspicion. The lifter's total lifts have surpassed typical benchmarks for natural lifters of their age and weight category. While some athletes may progress significantly due to proper training and technique, the steep upward trend and current total results are uncommon, especially for a lifter in their early 40s.

Overall, considering the rate of improvement and the high performance levels achieved, there is a reasonable suspicion of possible performance-enhancing drug use.

Rating: 8/10
