The lifter in question has shown a significant progression in performance from August 2018 to July 2019. Starting with a total lift of 290.0 kg, the lifter achieved a peak total of 347.5 kg by April 2019, indicating a growth of 57.5 kg (approximately 19.83%) over approximately nine months.

When breaking down the individual lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift), the lifter demonstrates consistent increases across all three disciplines, peaking at 145.0 kg in the deadlift while maintaining a relatively stable body weight around 61-63 kg. The rate of improvement, particularly from 325.0 kg to 335.0 kg, and then to 347.5 kg, can be considered somewhat rapid for someone who is still in the early stages of their powerlifting career, especially given that the lifter is female and competing at a lighter weight class.

While the lifter's current totals are impressive, they are not exceptionally high when contextualized against competitive standards for elite female lifters, especially considering their age. However, the substantial jumps in total lifted weight over a short period may raise some flags regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Given these observations, while the performance is impressive, the rate of improvement raises some concern. Based on the data, I would assign a likelihood of 6/10 regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs. This indicates that while there is some evidence for suspicion, it is not definitive.
