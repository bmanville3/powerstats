The lifter in question demonstrates a noticeable improvement in performance over the analyzed period. Starting with a total lift of 290.0 kg in March 2016 at the age of 23.5 and a bodyweight of approximately 61.3 kg, the lifter achieved notable records in subsequent competitions.

In December 2017, despite a drop in total performance to 245.0 kg at a lower bodyweight of 51.5 kg, the lifter rebounded with a substantial increase in total lift to 295.0 kg in December 2018, while maintaining a similar bodyweight of around 51.7 kg.

The most striking aspect of this data is the significant jump in total lift achieved from 245.0 kg to 295.0 kg within a relatively short time frame of just under a year, alongside the maintenance of a lighter weight class. The lift totals also reflect strong, competitive squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers that, for a female lifter in the 52 kg category, are quite high.

While improvements can certainly happen in powerlifting, the combination of rapid progress and high absolute performances, particularly in relation to the lifter’s weight class, raises some concerns about potential performance-enhancing drug use. The lifter's performance metrics seem to indicate that this could be an athlete who has benefited significantly from substances, especially considering the context of female lifters in lower weight classes.

Taking all of this into account, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 8/10.
