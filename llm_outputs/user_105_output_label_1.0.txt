The lifter, aged 15.5, has recorded a total of 502.5 kg in a powerlifting competition, broken down into a squat of 172.5 kg, bench press of 130.0 kg, and deadlift of 200.0 kg. Given the lifter's young age and substantial performance metrics, it is critical to analyze the data in the context of typical progression rates in youth lifters.

1. **Performance Metrics**: At 15.5 years old, a total lift of 502.5 kg, particularly with a deadlift of 200.0 kg, is notably high for this age and weight class. Generally, young lifters tend to improve rapidly, but such absolute performance raises concerns, especially in the absence of a longer lifting history.

2. **Rate of Improvement**: While not specified, any rapid improvements in performance over a short time can indicate potential use of performance-enhancing substances. If this lifter has recently seen significant leaps in their totals, this would heighten suspicion.

3. **Physical and Biological Considerations**: At a bodyweight of 82.5 kg, the ratio of weight lifted to bodyweight is impressive but could be viewed as outside typical norms for a lifter of this age and maturity.

4. **Overall Consideration**: Given their young age, the high totals, and the need for consistent improvement in competitive powerlifting, there are notable red flags. While natural talent and training can lead to impressive totals, the combination of age and performance suggests a need for scrutiny.

Taking these factors into account, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
