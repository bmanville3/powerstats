The lifter showed a significant improvement in performance between the two dates provided. In June 2021, they achieved a total lift of 290.0 kg, with their squat, bench press, and deadlift at 92.0 kg, 58.0 kg, and 140.0 kg, respectively. By March 2023, their total lift increased to 350.0 kg, with their squat, bench press, and deadlift reaching 117.5 kg, 67.5 kg, and 165.0 kg.

This represents an overall increase of 60 kg in total lift over approximately 21 months. Breaking this down further, the lifter gained an average of around 2.86 kg per month, which is a substantial improvement, particularly for a lifter who already had a notable baseline performance.

Given that the increase in performance is marked—especially at a relatively lower body weight of 60.25 kg and considering the lifter's age of 31.5 years by the second date—this raises some flags. The improvement rate appears fast for a female lifter at this weight category, where gains can often be more gradual.

While many factors can influence performance, including training, technique improvements, and nutrition, the rapid progression in this case, coupled with the absolute total lift of 350.0 kg, could suggest potential performance-enhancing drug use.

On a scale of 1-10 regarding the likelihood of drug use for this lifter, I would rate it as 7/10.
