The lifter exhibits a significant progression in strength over time, starting with a total lift of 465.0 kg at a bodyweight of approximately 83.2 kg in 2014, and reaching an impressive 755.0 kg at a bodyweight of 109.7 kg in 2022. This reflects a total increase of 290.0 kg over roughly 8 years, averaging about 36.25 kg per year.

While improvements are common in competitive powerlifting, the rapid escalation of performance — particularly from 2016 to 2022, where the lifter rose from 575.0 kg to 755.0 kg — raises some concerns. The lifter's 727.5 kg total at age 23.5 and the subsequent jump to 755.0 kg at age 24.5 appear quite pronounced relative to the earlier progression, especially given the substantial increases in the squat and deadlift numbers being reported.

Furthermore, the lifter's bodyweight increase of about 26.5 kg corresponds with the performance gains, which could suggest a natural progression, but the magnitude of the total lift and rate of improvement seems atypical without the influence of performance-enhancing substances, especially considering they are male and competing at higher levels.

Overall, while it is difficult to ascertain drug use definitively without more data, the lifter's performance trajectory does suggest a greater likelihood of enhanced assistance. Given these observations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10.
