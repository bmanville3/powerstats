The lifter shows significant improvement in their total lift from 409.0 kg to 432.5 kg within a two-week period. This represents a remarkable increase of 23.5 kg, or approximately 5.7%, which is an unusually high rate of improvement for a competitive lifter, especially considering their age of 18 and relatively lightweight body class of 78.05 kg.

Their squat, bench press, and deadlift (S/B/D) numbers also reflect positive changes: squat increased from 160.0 kg to 172.5 kg, bench press from 90.0 kg to 95.0 kg, and deadlift from 159.0 kg to 165.0 kg. While these individual lifts have also improved, the overall progression raises concerns about the speed of this enhancement.

Further scrutiny shows the total lifted (432.5 kg) is quite competitive for someone of this age and weight category, potentially suggesting a level of performance that might be considered high for an 18-year-old lifter.

Taking these factors into consideration—particularly the rapid performance increase and the absolute performance level—the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs seems elevated. Therefore, I would rate this lifter's suspicion level at 7/10.
