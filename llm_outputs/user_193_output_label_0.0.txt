The lifter shows a consistent progression in performance over a span of several years, moving from a total lift of 375.0 kg in May 2017 to 510.0 kg by November 2021. Key observations include:

1. **Progression Rate**: The lifter's total weight lifted increased rapidly, especially during the early stages. Notably, they added 110 kg within a year (from 375 kg to 485 kg, May 2017 to January 2018) and continued to improve steadily until peaking at 510 kg. This initial jump stands out as particularly significant for a lifter at such a young age.

2. **Age and Experience**: The lifter started at just 16.5 years old and has maintained competitive totals into their early twenties. The age and relatively quick transition into more advanced totals can be indicative of either exceptional talent, rigorous training, or potential use of performance-enhancing substances.

3. **Bodyweight Considerations**: The lifter’s body weight has only slightly increased over the years, suggesting that the performance improvements are not merely due to an increase in weight class. This could point to a genuine improvement in strength rather than a temporary gain from weight manipulation.

4. **Consistency and Duplicates**: Several entries feature duplicate totals on the same day, which may indicate either a lack of competitive environment or reliability in performance on those occasions.

In summary, while the lifter has shown remarkable progress and consistency, the rapid improvement, especially early in their career, combined with the young age at which these totals were achieved, raises concerns regarding the possibility of performance-enhancing drug use.

Given these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
