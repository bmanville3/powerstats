The lifter's performance shows a notable upward trend in total weight lifted over a relatively short timeframe. Starting with a total of 605.0 kg at age 17.5, the lifter increased to 655.0 kg in less than a year, and further to 680.0 kg just a few months later. This represents a total increase of 75 kg (approximately 12.4%) within about 15 months, which is a significant rate of progression for a lifter, particularly considering they are still in their teens.

Additionally, the lifter's strength in individual lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift) has also seen considerable improvements—most notably, a jump from a combined 605.0 kg to 680.0 kg in a relatively short span. The lifter's bodyweight has increased marginally (around 2 kg), yet their lifting totals have surged, which suggests that they are potentially gaining strength at a rate that is not entirely consistent with natural progression, particularly for a lifter who is still developing physically.

While individual circumstances can vary greatly, such rapid improvement and high absolute totals—especially considering their young age—in a sport where strength gains can often take years to manifest raise suspicions of drug use. Based on the data presented, I would assess the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs to be 8/10.
