The lifter's performance data presents a compelling trajectory, showcasing a significant increase in total weight lifted over time. Starting with a total of 442.5 kg in April 2017, the lifter progressively improved their totals to 747.5 kg by October 2018. This marks an increase of 305 kg in just over a year and a half, which is an exceptionally high rate of progression, particularly for a male lifter at this level.

Furthermore, looking at the individual lifts, the lifter's squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers show substantial gains, with notably drastic jumps, such as a 85 kg increase in total from 660 kg in July 2017 to 747.5 kg in October 2018. These types of gains are often characteristic of new lifters, but the athlete's age and previous lifting totals suggest that they are past the beginner phase, making such rapid gains less typical.

The lifter's absolute performance peaks at 747.5 kg, which is quite high for their bodyweight of 118.5 kg. Although advanced lifters can achieve impressive totals, the combination of age, bodyweight, and extremely rapid progress raises red flags.

Overall, considering the lifter's explosive progression, the relatively high totals for their weight class, and the lack of long-term experience that would typically temper such growth, there is a notable degree of suspicion regarding potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.
