The lifter's performance shows a notable increase in total lifted weight over a relatively short period. From December 2018 to June 2019, the total increased from 300kg to 335kg, representing an increase of 35kg in just six months. This translates to an average increase of approximately 5.8kg per month, which is significant, especially considering the lifter is already at a competitive level.

Additionally, the lifter's bodyweight increased by around 6.15kg during this period, which is consistent with the increase in total lifted weight but could also suggest a favorable adaptation if the weight gain was primarily lean mass. However, the increase in total lift performance outpaces typical natural progressions seen in powerlifting, especially for an athlete who was already competitive.

Given the rapid progression and the absolute performance levels—particularly in the squat and deadlift categories—it raises some red flags regarding potential performance-enhancing drug (PED) use. While age and increased bodyweight can naturally contribute to improved performance, the scale and speed of the improvements are often seen in contexts where athletes may be using PEDs to enhance their results.

Overall, considering the parameters of performance improvement, the lifter appears suspicious for drug use. My assessment of the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use for this lifter is 8/10.
