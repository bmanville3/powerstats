The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over a relatively short period, increasing their total lift from 452.5 kg to 500 kg in just under five months. This represents a significant gain of 47.5 kg, approximately a 10.5% increase, which is unusually high for a lifter, especially one under 18 years old.

In terms of absolute performance, the lifter's totals are impressive for their age and bodyweight, especially considering their rapid increase in strength levels. At age 17.5, lifting 500 kg total while weighing 73 kg is above the average range for natural lifters, especially for someone in their age group.

While such gains can occasionally occur due to natural growth and training adaptations, the speed and magnitude of the improvements raise questions about the likelihood of drug use. Given these factors, there is a substantial concern regarding the potential for the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Based on the rapid increase in performance and the total weight lifted relative to their age and bodyweight, I would assess the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
