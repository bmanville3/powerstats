The lifter showed significant improvement between the two data entries. Initially, they had a total lift of 475.0 kg at a bodyweight of 86.6 kg, which indicates a solid performance for their weight class. However, by the second entry, just over five years later, the lifter's total increased to 775.0 kg at a bodyweight of 155.0 kg. This represents a remarkable gain of 300.0 kg in total lifts and a substantial increase in bodyweight.

The rate of increase in total poundage (approximately 63.0 kg per year) seems unusually fast for natural progression, especially considering the lifter is still only 18.5 years old and has already reached competitive levels that could be considered elite for their category.

While the absolute performance is impressive, such rapid improvement, combined with the significant weight gain, raises red flags regarding potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. Natural lifters typically see slower, more incremental gains, particularly after reaching a certain level of proficiency in the sport.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of them using performance-enhancing drugs at a 9/10.
