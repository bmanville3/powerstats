The lifter has shown a steady and significant improvement in performance over the years. Starting in 2015, their total lifted weight progressed from 447.5 kg to a peak of 678 kg in 2020, demonstrating an increase of 230.5 kg over five years. This translates to an average annual increase of approximately 46.1 kg, which is substantial, particularly considering the lifter's age during this period.

In terms of age and performance, the lifter began at 16.5 years old, reaching a total of 651.0 kg by age 20.5, with a consistent upward trajectory and only minor fluctuations afterward. The progression from 475 kg to over 600 kg is notably steep, especially considering that such increases are typically substantial in the later stages of a lifting career.

Additionally, the lifter's bodyweight appears relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations around the 82 kg mark as they matured into their early 20s. The lifting totals while maintaining a stable bodyweight could indicate a focus on strength without significant weight gain, which can sometimes be a red flag for drug use in strength training.

Given the significant performance increase relative to age and bodyweight, alongside the generally consistent results, there are critical indicators that suggest potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. Specifically, the rapid increases in total lifts and the high absolute performance levels, especially at a young age, lead to concerns about the lifter’s compliance with anti-doping regulations.

Taking these factors into account, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10.
