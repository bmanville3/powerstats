The lifter in question has an impressive total lift of 655.0 kg at a body weight of approximately 98.9 kg, resulting in a competitive performance level. At just 19.5 years of age, achieving a squat of 237.5 kg, a bench press of 165.0 kg, and a deadlift of 252.5 kg indicates significant strength capabilities, particularly for their weight class.

Examining the numbers more closely, the lifter's total lifts suggest a high level of performance for their age and weight. While it’s common for young athletes to exhibit rapid improvement, the absolute weights lifted, especially in conjunction with their age, raise some flags. Typically, lifters at this age may still be developing their strength base, and such totals might indicate potential artificial enhancement.

Additionally, if there is limited historical data showing progressive improvement, the rapid rise in performance could be suspect. If the lifter has improved significantly in a short timeframe without a corresponding increase in training experience or age, it further suggests possible use of performance-enhancing substances.

Given these factors—young age, high performance relative to peers, and potential rapid improvement—the likelihood of drug use appears moderate to high.

I would assess the suspicion of performance-enhancing drug use as 7/10.
