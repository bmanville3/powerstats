The lifter's performance shows a significant improvement over the recorded time frames. Initially, on May 20, 2023, the lifter totaled 550.0 kg at a bodyweight of 87.7 kg. By October 14, 2023, they reached 755.0 kg, signifying a substantial increase of 205.0 kg in just under five months. This upward trend continued with consistent totals of 755.0 kg in June 2024, and 802.5 kg in September 2024, culminating in 852.5 kg on January 18, 2025. This represents an increase of 297.5 kg over less than two years, which is quite substantial for a lifter of their age and experience level.

The lifter also experienced a marked increase in bodyweight, jumping from 87.7 kg to 136.5 kg over the same period. Such rapid improvement in both total weight lifted and bodyweight raises suspicion. Notably, their performance trajectory appears excessively accelerated; gaining nearly 300 kg in total lift within about 18 months is atypical without performance-enhancing substances, especially for a relatively young athlete (age 20.5 to 22.5).

Considering both the rate of performance improvement and the absolute totals in relation to their age and development, there are grounds for concern regarding potential drug use. Therefore, I assess the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as an 8/10.
