The lifter's performance shows a noticeable increase in total weight lifted over the three recorded dates. Starting from a total of 617.5 kg in April 2018, the lifter progressed to 630.0 kg by July 2018 and reached 647.5 kg by December 2018. This represents an overall increase of 30 kg over approximately eight months, which translates to an average increase of about 3.75 kg per month. While consistent improvement is typical in powerlifting, such a rate of increase is marginally aggressive for an experienced lifter, especially considering they are already competing at a high level.

The lifter's bodyweight slightly fluctuated but remained within a similar range, indicating that performance gains were not solely attributable to weight class advantages. The bench press and deadlift numbers increased significantly, particularly the deadlift which grew from 227.5 kg to 247.5 kg, suggesting a rapid improvement that may raise concerns about performance enhancement.

Given the lifter's age (33.5 years), they are at an age where gains may start to slow down, which further makes the acceleration in performance notable. While not definitive, the combination of rapid improvement, particularly in lifts that often require extensive training, alongside the maintenance of a competitive bodyweight, could suggest the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Taking all factors into account, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10. This indicates a strong suspicion based on performance trends and expected progress within the sport.
