The lifter, a 20.5-year-old female competing at a bodyweight of 66.6 kg, has posted a total lift of 292.5 kg, comprised of a squat of 112.5 kg, bench press of 52.5 kg, and deadlift of 127.5 kg. This performance indicates a solid foundation for her weight class.

In analyzing her performance, a total lift of 292.5 kg at this bodyweight is commendable but not extraordinary for a lifter with some experience. However, if this is a recent performance, especially early in her lifting career, it may raise concerns about the rapidity of her progress as she is still young. The combination of age, relative lifting totals, and potential rapid improvements can often correlate with the use of performance-enhancing drugs, particularly if her previous results were significantly lower.

Moreover, the rates of progress in female lifters can vary significantly, but extreme and sudden jumps in competition totals or squat, bench, and deadlift numbers could be indicative of enhanced training techniques or substance use.

Considering these factors, while the lifter's absolute performance is competitive but not outlandishly high, the potential for rapid progression does raise some suspicions. Therefore, I would assign a likelihood score of 5/10, as there is a moderate concern, but more information on her training history and progression would be necessary for a definitive judgment.

5/10
