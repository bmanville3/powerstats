The lifter shows notable improvement between the two competition dates. From February 26, 2022, to December 18, 2022, their total lifted weight increased from 517.5 kg to 557.5 kg, representing an increase of 40 kg over approximately 10 months. This gain is significant, especially considering the lifter's age (49.5 years) and relatively stable bodyweight (increased from 89.10 kg to 89.60 kg).

Analyzing the individual lifts, the squat improved from 190.0 kg to 217.5 kg, a gain of 27.5 kg; the bench press remained the same at 125.0 kg; and the deadlift increased from 202.5 kg to 215.0 kg, a gain of 12.5 kg. Notably, the squat increase is substantial relative to the lifter's experience level, suggesting a potential for enhanced training methods or external assistance.

Given the age of the lifter and the rapid progression in performance, especially in the squat, there is a level of suspicion regarding potential drug use. While there isn't definitive evidence from the data alone, the significant increase over a relatively short time frame coupled with the lifter's age does raise concerns typically associated with performance-enhancing drug use.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this individual using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10.
