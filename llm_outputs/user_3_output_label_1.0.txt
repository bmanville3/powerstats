The lifter in question demonstrates a consistent upward trajectory in total weight lifted over the years, moving from a total of 285.0 kg in August 2012 to a peak of 335.0 kg by October 2019. Notably, there are several significant jumps in performance, particularly from November 2014 to October 2015, where the lifter increased their total from 332.5 kg to 335.0 kg, and again in 2015-2016, with very little fluctuation in body weight.

The lifter's body weight has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between approximately 46.5 kg and 51.7 kg. This is particularly important as it suggests that the increases in total weight lifted are not simply due to gains in body weight, which can often mask less favorable strength-to-weight ratios.

The rate of increase in performance appears quite rapid, especially given that the lifter is already at an advanced age (the lifter is 43.5 years old by the last recorded data). The total weight lifted per year shows a step-wise increase rather than a gradual progression, which may indicate either a natural peak in potential or a possible influence of performance-enhancing substances.

In summary, while there could be many legitimate factors contributing to this lifter's performance, the combination of a relatively high rate of increase in total weight, maintenance of low body weight, and age raises some concerns. Given these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
