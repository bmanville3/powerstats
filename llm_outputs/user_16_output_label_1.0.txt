The lifter's progression over time shows a consistent increase in total lifted weight, moving from 560.0 kg in October 2015 to 695.0 kg in October 2018. This represents a total increase of 135.0 kg in just three years, averaging approximately 45 kg improvement per year. Notably, the lifter was only 19 years old at the start, which is relatively young for peak performance in powerlifting.

While performance gains can be attributed to natural growth, training, and experience, the rate of increase is quite substantial, especially given that the lifter is still in a relatively early stage of their career. Additionally, the lifter's bodyweight remained relatively stable around 82 kg while significantly increasing their total lifts—indicative of a favorable strength-to-weight ratio but also raising questions about the legitimacy of such rapid improvement in conjunction with age and weight class.

The gains in squat, bench press, and deadlift reflect not only an improvement in technique and training but also a potential red flag. The standard for a natural lifter, especially in the context of youth and developmental changes, generally does not support such a swift rise without a suggestion of performance-enhancing aid.

Given these factors—rapid progression, relative youth, and high total lifted weight for the age and bodyweight—the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use appears significant.

Rating: 8/10
