The lifter, at 19 years old and weighing approximately 97.55 kg, has achieved a total lift of 627.5 kg with a breakdown of 210 kg in the squat, 162.5 kg in the bench press, and 255 kg in the deadlift.

When analyzing their performance, it's notable that lifting totals in the 600 kg range at such a young age, particularly for an athlete who is still developing both physically and technically, can be considered remarkable. The squat and bench press numbers are solid, but the deadlift stands out, indicating a potentially significant strength adaptation.

In terms of rate of performance improvement, without more data on the lifter's previous totals, it's difficult to assess how rapidly they have progressed. However, if this total has been reached over a short training period with little prior lifting experience, it could raise suspicions about the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Although it's essential to consider genetic predispositions, commitment to training, and nutritional factors, a combination of high performance at a young age and rapid improvements can often correlate with drug use in strength sports.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
