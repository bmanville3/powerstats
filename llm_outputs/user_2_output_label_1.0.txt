### Performance Analysis

The lifter shows a steady progression in total lift weight from 765.0 kg in 2012 to a peak of 910.0 kg in 2019, indicating a significant improvement over a span of approximately seven years. This equates to an increase of 145.0 kg, averaging roughly 20.71 kg per year. While some improvement in powerlifting is expected, the lifter's performance increase appears particularly rapid, especially considering their relatively young starting age of 18 and their competitive level.

Several observations stand out:

1. **Age vs. Performance**: The lifter began competing at a very young age (18) and has consistently improved. Rapid gains in strength are common in beginners, especially those who are still growing. However, the increase in performance after the initial couple of years seems excessive for the athlete's age and experience level.

2. **Bodyweight and Class**: The lifter's bodyweight fluctuated between 115 to 125 kg, indicating that they have not made drastic changes in weight class. Sustaining performance while maintaining a stable bodyweight suggests improved efficiency and potentially enhanced muscle mass, which can be a sign of significant training, but also of performance-enhancing methods, especially at higher weights.

3. **Statistical Consistency**: The lifter exhibited multiple identical results (e.g., multiple entries of 792.5 kg, 805.0 kg, etc.), which may indicate either a lack of new competitive lifts or a pattern indicating potential manipulation in performance reporting.

4. **Pace of Improvement**: The peak total lift of 910.0 kg by age 25 is relatively high for a lifter competing mostly at a sub-125 kg weight class. This might raise eyebrows in the powerlifting community regarding natural progression versus possible substance use.

### Conclusion

Considering the rapid improvement, consistent high performance relative to bodyweight, and the presence of duplicative entries, there is a potential concern regarding drug use. While athletic performance can vary due to numerous factors, the overall trend, particularly in the context of competitive lifting, suggests that drug testing is warranted for this athlete.

**Likelihood of Drug Use: 7/10**
