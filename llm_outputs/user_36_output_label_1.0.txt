The lifter's performance shows a clear progression over the years. Starting with a total lift of 630.0 kg in 2012, they increased their total to 660.0 kg by late 2013, marking a gain of 30.0 kg in just over a year. This is a significant increase, especially for an experienced lifter who was already 39 years old at that point.

From late 2013 to late 2015, the lifter's total increased from 660.0 kg to 702.5 kg, reflecting an additional gain of 42.5 kg over a span of roughly two years. Although this might seem more gradual than the previous increase, the lifter went through considerable weight fluctuations, with body weight ranging from approximately 100.4 kg to 106.7 kg. Notably, their performance peaked at 702.5 kg in December 2015, which is impressive, given that they were 41 years old.

The lifter's squat, bench press, and deadlift performances suggest competence but also raise some flags when viewed in context. Their lifts progressed to a level that is notably high for the age and weight category, especially when paired with relatively modest bodyweight fluctuations.

Considering the following:
1. The rapid performance increases over short timespans—most notably the gains from 2012 to 2013.
2. The peak total lift of 702.5 kg at 41 years old, which is quite competitive.
3. The consistency of performance improvement, while age and weight shouldn’t typically allow for such substantial increases.

These factors combined suggest a possibility of performance-enhancing drug use, particularly given the lifter’s age and the nature of their gains. Based on this analysis, I would rate the likelihood of drug use as follows:

7/10
