### Suspicion of Drug Use

The lifter’s rapid progression is noteworthy, as increasing total lifts by 65 kg and then 80 kg in such a short timeframe is extraordinary, especially for an athlete of this age and weight category. Typically, young athletes see gains in strength, but the magnitude and speed of these improvements suggest a possibility of performance-enhancing drug use.

The absolute performances, particularly in the deadlift, which jumped to **122.5 kg**, could be considered unusually advanced for a 13.5-year-old weighing under 50 kg. This raises red flags, particularly given the lifter's age and the context of their growth.

### Likelihood of Drug Use

Based on the rapid and substantial increases in total lift and the high level of performance for the athlete’s age and bodyweight, the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs is relatively high.

**Rating: 8/10**
