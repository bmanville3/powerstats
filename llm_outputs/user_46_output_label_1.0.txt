The data reflects the performance of a female lifter over a span of approximately eight years. Her total lift gradually increased from 305.0 kg in February 2016 to a peak of 400.0 kg in December 2019, showing a notable improvement. After 2019, the lifter maintained a strong performance, consistently lifting above 345.0 kg in 2023 and reaching 390.0 kg in March 2024.

Key observations:

1. **Performance Improvement**: The lifter shows a significant increase in total weight lifted, particularly between 2017 and 2019, where her total jumped from 317.5 kg to 400.0 kg. This represents a rapid and impressive progression over a relatively short period, totaling an increase of 82.5 kg in less than three years.

2. **Age Considerations**: The lifter was 49 years old when she began her recorded performances, and her age increased throughout her career. Generally, lifters tend to peak in their early 30s, and maintaining such high performance in their late 50s, as seen here, may be unusual.

3. **Bodyweight Trends**: The lifter's bodyweight fluctuated but mostly remained within the 73-80 kg range. While her performance increased, her bodyweight did not consistently correlate with the increases in lifting totals.

4. **Red Flags**: The rate of performance improvements, particularly the jump to 400.0 kg at age 53, along with her ability to maintain a high performance level into her 50s, raises some questions. The consistent performance despite age indicates a potential for enhanced training methods or possibly the use of Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs).

Considering these aspects, the lifter exhibits a progression that is ambitious for her age and shows rapid improvement that could be seen as suspicious in the context of drug testing protocols.

Given the rapid increases, performance level relative to age, and lack of decline, I rate the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use at 7/10.
