The lifter's performance data indicates a notable progression over time, particularly from December 2016 to March 2017, where he increased his total lift from 630.0kg to 650.0kg. This represents a significant improvement of 20.0kg in just three months, which is relatively substantial for competitive lifters. However, performance improvements are not unusual at younger ages, especially from 24 to 25 years.

In later entries, particularly in 2018, the total dropped to 617.5kg, suggesting fluctuations typical in athletic performance, possibly due to training cycles or recovery periods. A significant drop in performance can indicate overtraining or lack of recovery but is not inherently suspicious.

The next noteworthy lift was in January 2023, with a total of 625.0kg, showing a return to near his 2017 peak. The lifter's age at this point (30.5 years) may correspond with a more stable performance level, but the drop and subsequent return raise the question of consistency and potential overtraining recovery.

Concerning absolute performance, while the lifter's totals are impressive, they are not exceptionally above typical levels for his weight class, particularly for an experienced male lifter. However, the rapid progression and performance peaks might suggest a potential for drug use, especially given the age category shifts and significant fluctuations in performance.

Given these considerations, I'd rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 6/10. This reflects a moderate suspicion due to notable performance improvements without consistent advancement and significant fluctuations in total lifted weight.
