The lifter's performance shows an increase in total lifted weight from 625.0 kg in 2012 to 632.5 kg in 2016, which is a modest gain of 7.5 kg over four years. Given the lifter's age and consistent bodyweight (81.7 kg to 81.8 kg), the progress appears reasonable.

Analyzing the breakdown of lifts, the squat decreased from 205.0 kg to 197.5 kg, while the bench press improved from 147.5 kg to 162.5 kg, and the deadlift remained constant at 272.5 kg. This indicates fluctuations in performance, particularly in the squat, which might reflect training or injury challenges.

In terms of performance enhancement, considering the moderate increase in total lifted weight over a notable period, coupled with the stability in bodyweight, suggests responsible training rather than rapid progression typical of drug usage. This lifts cast doubt on a substantial likelihood of performance-enhancing drugs.

Based on this analysis, I would estimate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 3/10.
