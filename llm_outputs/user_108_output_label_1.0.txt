The data indicates that the lifter has shown significant improvements over the years.

1. **Initial Performance (2003)**: At age 21.5, the lifter achieved a total of 475.0 kg with a bodyweight of 83.8 kg. Their squat (S) was 155.0 kg, bench (B) 110.0 kg, and deadlift (D) 210.0 kg.

2. **Subsequent Performance (2022)**: Nearly two decades later, at age 29, the lifter reached a total of 517.5 kg with a bodyweight of 109.3 kg. The lifts improved to 190.0 kg in squat, 112.5 kg in bench, and 215.0 kg in deadlift.

3. **Performance Analysis**: The total lift increased by 42.5 kg, approximately an 8.9% increase over 19 years, which is reasonable in the context of natural progression. However, the growth in bodyweight (+25.5 kg) is noteworthy, as it suggests a significant shift in muscle mass or potential weight class changes.

4. **Drug Use Suspicion**: Given the lifter's consistent performance increases over a long period without dramatic spikes or unrealistic progressions, the overall rate of improvement does not appear suspicious. Moreover, the performance is reasonably aligned with the norms for powerlifters, especially considering the age and experience.

Based on these observations, there is no strong evidence indicating the likelihood of drug use, so I would rate their probability of using performance-enhancing drugs as 3/10.
