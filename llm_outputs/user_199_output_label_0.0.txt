### Performance Analysis

The lifter has demonstrated a notable improvement in their performance over a relatively short period. From May 11, 2024, to September 21, 2024, their total lift increased from 555.0 kg to 580.0 kg, an increase of 25 kg. Considering their age of 17.5 and a bodyweight of approximately 73 kg, this is a significant improvement in a brief time frame, particularly against the backdrop of the typical developmental curve for an athlete at this stage.

1. **Rate of Performance Improvement**:
   - An increase of 25 kg in total lifts within approximately four months is substantial. While adolescent lifters can experience rapid gains due to natural growth and training adaptations, this level of improvement may raise suspicions regarding the influence of performance-enhancing substances.

2. **Absolute Performance Levels**:
   - A total lift of 580 kg at this bodyweight is competitive, especially for a lifter of this age. The individual's squat (200 kg), bench press (135 kg), and deadlift (245 kg) are also impressive and suggest a well-rounded ability, but such totals are often seen in more experienced lifters.

Given the combination of rapid performance increases and relatively high absolute performance for their age and weight class, the lifter may be operating above expected norms for a natural athlete, which raises concerns about possible drug use.

### Likelihood of Drug Use:
Based on the analysis, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as **8/10**.
