The lifter demonstrates a significant upward trajectory in performance over a span of just over two years. Starting from a total lift of 240.0kg in November 2022, they progressed to an impressive 322.5kg by January 2025. This represents an increase of 82.5kg in total lifting capacity, which is substantial, especially given the relatively short time frame and their status as a lifter in the women's category at a lower bodyweight of around 58kg.

Analyzing the individual lifts, the squat increased from 95.0kg to 115.0kg, the bench press from 52.5kg to 62.5kg, and the deadlift from 92.5kg to 145.0kg. The latter, especially, shows a marked improvement; a jump of 52.5kg in deadlift alone over this period raises red flags regarding training methodology and potential drug use.

Overall, the rate of performance increase seems atypical for a natural athlete, particularly given the lifter's age and bodyweight class. Typical performance improvements for natural athletes tend to be more gradual, especially at advanced levels of competition.

Considering the rapid gains seen here, along with the relatively high total weight lifted in such a short time frame, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10. This indicates a strong suspicion, though not conclusive evidence without further data.
