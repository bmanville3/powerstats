The lifter's performance indicates a continuous progression in total lifts from 272.5 kg in January 2021 to 485.0 kg in January 2024. This marks an increase of 212.5 kg over approximately three years, or roughly 70.8 kg per year. While improvement is typical in powerlifting, such a rapid increase in total weight, particularly by a lifter who started at an already competitive level, raises some flags.

Key observations include:

1. **Age and Experience**: The lifter started competing at 18 and made significant improvements during their early years. Although younger athletes often improve quickly, the magnitude of the increase is notable.

2. **Consistency**: The lifter has shown consistent gains over time, with performance peaking from a total of 387.5 kg in January 2022 to 485.0 kg in January 2024. Such consistent upward trends can sometimes correlate with drug use, especially given the substantial jumps.

3. **Bodyweight**: The lifter has maintained a relatively stable body weight around 74 kg while making significant gains. This suggests a very efficient increase in strength-to-weight ratio but could indicate artificial assistance if the gains appear disproportionate to natural physiological limits.

4. **Lifting Figures**: Notable increases in individual lifts (from 102.5 kg squat to 195.0 kg, and 50.0 kg bench to 87.5 kg) reflect a dramatic improvement, further emphasizing the potential for performance-enhancing interventions.

In summary, while the lifter has demonstrated remarkable progress, the rate of improvement and the level of performance achieved—especially given their young age—suggest a higher likelihood of using performance-enhancing drugs.
