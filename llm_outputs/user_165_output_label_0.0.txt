The lifter’s performance shows a notable upward trajectory from a total lift of 567.5 kg on November 20, 2021, to 630.0 kg on August 12, 2023—a gain of 62.5 kg over approximately 20 months. This represents an average increase of over 3 kg per month, which may be considered rapid, especially for an athlete already at a high level of performance.

The lifter has consistently improved across all three lifts (squat, bench press, and deadlift), with significant increases in each category:
- Squat: From 200.0 kg to 220.0 kg
- Bench Press: From 112.5 kg to 120.0 kg
- Deadlift: From 255.0 kg to 290.0 kg

While improvements in performance can occur naturally with dedicated training, the rate of progression here (particularly in the deadlift, where the increase of 35 kg is substantial) raises some concerns.

Additionally, the lifter has maintained a relatively stable bodyweight around 80 kg while making these gains, which is typically difficult to achieve without some form of external assistance, as an increase in strength often correlates with changes in body composition.

Considering the combination of rapid performance improvements, significant absolute numbers, and consistent bodyweight, there are indicators that suggest potential drug use. However, it is essential to note that many factors can influence performance increases, including training methods, genetics, and experience.

Based on this analysis, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10.
