The lifter in question achieved a total of 212.5kg at a bodyweight of 62.2kg in a powerlifting competition, with the individual lifts recorded as 70.0kg (squat), 42.5kg (bench press), and 100.0kg (deadlift). At 28.5 years of age, the lifter is in a competitive age range that typically shows a peak in performance.

When evaluating performance metrics, the total lifted appears to be respectable for a female lifter, but the squat and bench press numbers are relatively low compared to the deadlift, which is notably high at 100kg. This disparity in lifts raises some flags, as an overly proficient deadlift combined with lower squat and bench lifts is less typical in a balanced lifting style.

Moreover, without a history of previous performance data to establish a trend, it's challenging to assess the improvement rate. However, if there were significant, rapid increases in total weight lifted over a short period, it could suggest unnatural enhancement.

While the overall performance appears commendable, the combination of an exceptional deadlift relative to other lifts, coupled with the absence of a historical performance trend, raises some concerns about the possible use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Based on the current data and the peculiarities observed in their lifts, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 7/10.
