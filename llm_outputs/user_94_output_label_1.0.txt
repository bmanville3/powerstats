The lifter in question has demonstrated significant progress in their performance over a span of three months, successfully increasing their total lifted weight from 627.5 kg to 655.0 kg. This is an increase of 27.5 kg, which translates to approximately 4.4% improvement in total weight. Notably, both the bodyweight and strength levels are also on the rise; while bodyweight increased from 104.4 kg to 110.4 kg, there was a corresponding increase in squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers.

Given that the lifter's age is 39.5 years, such a rapid increase in performance raises questions. Typically, athletes in this age group experience a decline in performance or slower progression, especially in strength sports like powerlifting. Furthermore, the lift increases observed, along with a noticeable rise in bodyweight, may suggest that the lifter is attempting to maximize their performance in a relatively short time frame, which can be indicative of the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Based on the data presented—particularly the rapid progression and the lifter's demographic factors—a suspicion of drug use arises. While further information about training regimen, history, and consistency in performance would provide a more comprehensive assessment, the current data warrants concern.

Given these observations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
