The lifter's total weight lifted of 605.0 kg, combined with a bodyweight of approximately 101.7 kg at the age of 22.5, indicates a strong performance relative to their weight class. The breakdown of their lifts—230 kg in the squat, 125 kg in the bench press, and 250 kg in the deadlift—suggests a balanced approach across the three disciplines of powerlifting.

When analyzing progression, the absolute totals appear competitive for an athlete of this age and weight. However, without data on their lifting history, it's challenging to assess the rate of improvement. If this total represents a recent milestone compared to their previous bests, it could suggest an accelerated progress rate, which could raise suspicions.

On the surface, the figures do not seem excessively high when considering elite levels of competition; however, the lifter's relatively young age could imply room for rapid gains that may not align with typical natural progression.

Considering the balance of their performance, the age and bodyweight, alongside the potential for rapid improvements that might stem from performance-enhancing drugs, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at a moderate level.
