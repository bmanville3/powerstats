The lifter in question shows a notable upward progression in performance over time, with total lifts increasing from 367.5 kg in April 2016 to 425 kg by April 2017, and a peak of 437.5 kg in October 2017. The increase is approximately 60 kg over a period of 18 months, which translates to an average gain of about 3.3 kg per month—a considerable improvement given the lifter's age (43.5 years at their peak performance).

Moreover, the lifter's bodyweight has also shown nominal increases, with the highest recorded weight being 112.5 kg for a total lift of 425 kg. While an increase in weight and strength can be reasonable in powerlifting, the rapid improvement, particularly in the squat and deadlift numbers, raises concerns. The lifter's performance appears to defy typical progressive overload, especially considering their age, as older lifters often experience slower progression compared to younger competitors.

Additionally, stability in performance is evident until their peak lift in late 2017, followed by a drop in totals (e.g., a decrease to 387.5 kg in February 2018), which is not uncommon but might suggest fatigue or a plateuing effect rather than healthy progression.

Given the substantial performance gains over a relatively short time frame and the potential for age-related physiological limits, this trajectory raises suspicion regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 8/10.
