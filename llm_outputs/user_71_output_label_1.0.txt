The lifter's performance shows a significant upward trajectory over the recorded dates.

1. **Performance Improvement**:
   - From December 2017 to April 2018, there is an increase in total lifting from 570.0 kg to 585.0 kg, an increase of 15.0 kg (2.63%).
   - From April 2018 to October 2018, the total lifts surged from 585.0 kg to 645.0 kg, an increase of 60.0 kg (10.26%).
   - This latter increase is particularly noteworthy, as a jump of 10% in a short span of around six months is relatively high for competitive lifters, suggesting rapid progress.

2. **Bodyweight Considerations**:
   - The lifter's bodyweight increased from 81.5 kg to 89.5 kg, a gain of 8 kg over approximately ten months. This increase in body mass could correlate with greater strength; however, the rate of strength gain appears disproportionate to the increase in bodyweight, raising suspicion.

3. **Age and Experience Factor**:
   - At age 27.5, the lifter is still at an age where significant natural improvements can occur, especially for somewhat younger athletes. However, the overall performance levels, particularly in the latter stages, seem unusually high relative to the gradual progression typically observed in natural athletes.

4. **Plateauing Expectations**:
   - Given the improvements noted, one would expect to see some signs of plateauing as the lifter nears their genetic potential; however, the substantial gains, particularly from April to October, could suggest external assistance.

In conclusion, while some athletes can achieve remarkable progress, the combination of high performance gains in a short period, disproportionate bodyweight gains relative to total lift increases, and the lack of evident plateauing raises red flags regarding the possibility of drug use. Overall, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10.
