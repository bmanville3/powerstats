The lifter's performance shows a significant upward trend from 525.0 kg in December 2013 to 730.0 kg in October 2017, indicating an increase of 205.0 kg over roughly four years. The most notable improvements occurred during 2015, where the total lifted rose from 610.0 kg to 622.5 kg, and then to 640.0 kg, with both peaks occurring within close succession. This period also features consecutive records, raising questions about the sustainability of such rapid progression.

In terms of bodyweight, the lifter's increase from 81 kg to 96.56 kg suggests a strategy of gaining weight perhaps to compete in higher classes, which can often correlate with increased strength. The lifting totals, especially the 730.0 kg lift at a bodyweight of 96.56 kg, appear remarkably high for a male lifter of this age and weight class, especially considering the linear growth in lifting totals over a relatively short competitive history.

Additionally, the lifter’s record-setting lifts, particularly the spike to 730.0 kg, raise flags for potential performance-enhancing drug use due to the rapid acceleration of their performance without notable plateaus or declines, which is atypical.

Taking into account the consistent increases in total lift weights, the relatively high performance metrics compared to age and weight standards, and the apparent lack of stagnation or decline in performance, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 8/10.
