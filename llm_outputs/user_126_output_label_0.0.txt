### Performance Analysis

The lifter has shown a significant increase in total lifting capacity over the recorded dates:

1. **2022-02-19**: 517.5 kg
2. **2022-07-30**: 610.0 kg (an increase of 92.5 kg in just over 5 months)
3. **2022-12-03**: 652.5 kg (an increase of 42.5 kg in about 4 months)

In total, the lifter has improved by 135 kg within a span of approximately 10 months. This rate of improvement is noteworthy, especially given the lifter's age of 18.5. Typically, athletes can experience rapid gains in their late teens due to natural growth factors, but such a substantial rise in total lift raises questions.

There are a few aspects that may raise suspicions:

- **Total Performance**: At 652.5 kg, the lifter's performance within their weight class (81.25 kg to 98.15 kg) is relatively high. For example, the raw totals in various federations show that this total is competitive even at higher levels.

- **Consistency**: The lifter recorded the same total twice on December 3, 2022, which might suggest either an error in reporting or an unusual situation that doesn't typically happen in competitions.

### Conclusion

While it's possible for young athletes to see rapid gains, the combination of the total lifted, the speed of improvement, and the repeated performance raises a flag of suspicion for potential drug use. This requires further investigation.

Rating: **8/10**
