The lifter in question has recorded a total lift of 337.5 kg at the age of 17, alongside a bodyweight of 98.5 kg. The individual’s squat (S) of 122.5 kg, bench press (B) of 67.5 kg, and deadlift (D) of 147.5 kg indicate a balanced proficiency across all three lifts.

While specific historical data regarding their performance progression over time is lacking, the total lift combined with their age raises some potential concerns. At 17, lifters often experience significant gains due to natural development, but such high totals—especially in the context of their bodyweight—suggest a performance level that could be atypical for their age group.

The performance metrics, while impressive, do not, on their own, definitively indicate drug use. However, the relative rapid accumulation of strength and the high total for their age category warrant scrutiny. If they have achieved these numbers in a short timeframe without a gradual progression or training history that aligns with such performance, it could increase suspicion.

On a scale of 1 to 10 regarding the likelihood of performance enhancing drug use, I would rate this lifter a 6/10. While not conclusive, the combination of their total lift, bodyweight, and age does warrant further investigation.
