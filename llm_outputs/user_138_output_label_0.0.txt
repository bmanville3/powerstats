The lifter's performance shows a significant and consistent increase in total lifted weight across the five entries, progressing from 262.5 kg to 350.0 kg over a two-year span. This represents a total increase of 87.5 kg, averaging approximately 43.75 kg gain per year.

1. **Age and Development**: The lifter began competing at age 14.5 and continued to develop into early adulthood. While individuals can experience rapid growth and strength gains during adolescence, the magnitude of this increase raises some questions.

2. **Bodyweight Consideration**: The lifter's bodyweight fluctuated but remained relatively stable around the low 80 kg range initially, moving to just under 94 kg by age 16.5. The increases in lifts seem proportionate, but the sharp gains in absolute numbers can warrant a closer look, especially considering the lifter’s young age.

3. **Strength Ratios**: The lifter’s squat (S), bench (B), and deadlift (D) numbers show a balanced progression. However, reaching a total of 350 kg by age 16.5, with a bodyweight of 93.6 kg, places this performance in a bracket that is notably high for a female lifter of this age and weight class.

4. **Performance Gains**: The rate of performance improvement appears fast, especially considering that the lifter achieved a 50 kg increase in total from March 2019 to February 2020, which is substantial for a natural trajectory.

Considering these factors, while it's not definitive evidence of drug use, the rapid gains in performance alongside the young age of the lifter do raise suspicions.

Rating: 7/10
