The lifter's performance data over the years shows a notable progression in total lifted weight, particularly from 2014 to 2015, where their total increased from 445.0kg to a peak of 466.0kg. This marks an improvement of 21.0kg within a span of just over a year, showcasing a significant increase in competitive performance as the lifter ages.

From 2016 onwards, the total lifted weight fluctuates but includes a drop to 335.0kg, which raises questions about consistency and potential factors affecting performance, especially as the lifter ages further. Despite this fluctuation, the peak performance remains relatively high considering the lifter is in their mid-70s, and their lifts—especially in the squat and deadlift—are certainly at the higher end for this age category.

Given that the lifter has consistently lifted well above 400kg total across multiple competitions while also experiencing rapid improvements and fluctuations in performance, there’s reason to be cautious. Their age, combined with the significant increases in total lifted weight within relatively short timespans, could suggest a potential use of performance-enhancing drugs, especially considering the physical decline typically associated with aging.

Overall, while there isn’t definitive evidence of drug use purely based on the data, the combination of performance peaks, age-related expectations, and rapid improvements does raise some suspicion.

Likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use: 6/10
