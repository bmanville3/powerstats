The lifter has shown a consistent upward trajectory in performance over the years, starting from a total lift of 530.0 kg at the age of 16 and progressing to 685.0 kg by age 20. This represents an increase of 155 kg in total performance over four years. Notably, the lifter's progression includes periods of rapid improvements, particularly between 2020 and 2021, where they went from a total of 625.0 kg to 650.0 kg, and then to 667.5 kg.

The increases in individual lifts also suggest significant gains; for example, the bench press increased from 120 kg to 145 kg over a relatively short timeframe. While some variability in bodyweight is observed, there is no dramatic fluctuation that might raise immediate concerns regarding drastic weight manipulation often associated with drug use.

However, the absolute total performance, particularly lifting over 675 kg at age 19, is notably high for a lifter of this age and weight class, suggesting potential for enhanced performance. Given the rapid progression and the elite performance levels achieved early in their career, this could raise suspicions.

Based on the combination of rapid performance improvements, high absolute totals for their age and weight category, and the lack of a clear plateau phase, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
