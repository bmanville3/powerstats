The lifter in question shows a notable progression in performance over the recorded years. Starting in 2014 with a total lift of 667.5kg, the athlete consistently improved to a peak of 775.5kg in 2019, marking an increase of 108kg over five years. This growth rate translates to an average increase of approximately 21.6kg per year, which is significant in powerlifting, particularly for an experienced lifter.

The athlete's body weight fluctuated slightly, but they generally maintained a stable weight around 106-110kg, which is appropriate for their weight class. Nevertheless, the lifter has shown improvements in individual lifts (Squat/Bench/Deadlift) that sometimes appear disproportionate, especially the increase in deadlift performance. Notably, their total lift exceeded 700kg by 2015, and subsequent totals have shown continual gains while maintaining body weight, which is less common as lifters age and reach their physical potential.

Repetitions of performance on the same date, specifically on 2016-10-13 and 2017-07-08, indicate consistent results, but such patterns can also raise questions regarding authenticity given the nature of these entries.

While the athlete's performance increases align with training and experience, the pace of improvement over time, particularly entering the 700+kg totals, can be conspicuous in the sport, suggesting potential drug use. This is especially true given the relatively rapid ascent within the context of their competitive history and age.

On a scale of 1-10 regarding the likelihood of using performance-enhancing drugs, I would rate this lifter at 7/10. Their performance trajectory, especially in context with their age and body weight, raises some red flags for potential substance use.
