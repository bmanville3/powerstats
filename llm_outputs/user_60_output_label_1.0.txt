The lifter has shown a consistent improvement in performance over time, increasing their total lift from 387.5kg in August 2021 to a peak of 432.5kg in September 2023. This represents an increase of 45kg over roughly two years, which is substantial. The lifter has also progressed in terms of age, starting at 47 years and moving to 48.5 years.

Analyzing the individual lifts, the squat has seen a consistent increase, from 150kg to 165kg. The bench press and deadlift have also shown positive trends, with the deadlift peaking at 177.5kg. However, there are irregularities in bodyweight, as the lifter fluctuated between 87.5kg and 89.1kg, but then dropped to 82.3kg while still managing a total lift of 400kg in April 2024. This indicates a potential strategy of rapid weight loss or manipulation, which is often associated with enhanced performance.

The overall improvements in performance appear fast-paced, especially considering the lifter's age, where most athletes experience slower progress or even decline. Moreover, the absolute lifting totals, particularly the recent jumps, might appear suspicious, especially when combined with significant weight management efforts.

Given these observations, the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs could be rated as 7/10. This score reflects noticeable performance improvements that may be inconsistent with natural progression for someone of their age and experience level.
