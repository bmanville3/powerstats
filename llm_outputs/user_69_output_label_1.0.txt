The lifter's performance shows a steady and significant improvement over the observed period from 2017 to 2020. Starting with a total lift of 615.0 kg at age 16.5, the lifter increased their total to 717.5 kg by age 19.5, representing a total increase of 102.5 kg over three years. This translates to an average increase of approximately 34.2 kg per year, which is noteworthy but not unprecedented in competitive powerlifting, especially among younger lifters.

Examining the individual lifts, the squat (S), bench press (B), and deadlift (D) all show marked improvement. The lifter's total performance reached a relatively high level of 717.5 kg, particularly for their age and bodyweight category. While substantial, it is not outside the realm of possibility for elite lifters, especially considering they are still at a young age where training adaptations can occur rapidly.

However, the rate of increase, especially over a span of just three years, could raise some questions. An increase of over 100 kg, particularly as the lifter transitions from adolescence to adulthood, might suggest the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs, especially if this improvement surpasses peer averages or other athletes in similar weight categories.

In summary, while the lifter's performance could be attributed to natural progression, the combination of their rapid improvement and current totals at a young age indicates a level of performance that could be deemed suspicious. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a **5/10**. This suggests a moderate level of suspicion based on their performance trajectory.
