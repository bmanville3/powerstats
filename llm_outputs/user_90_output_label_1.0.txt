The lifter's performance from 2016 to 2018 shows a steady and notable increase in total weight lifted. Key points include:

1. **Performance Improvement**: The lifter improved their total lifted weight from 455.0 kg in December 2016 to 512.5 kg by November 2018, reflecting an overall gain of 57.5 kg in just under two years. This translates to an average increase of approximately 2.4 kg per month.

2. **Age and Weight**: The lifter's age increased from 31.5 to 33.5 years, while bodyweight remained relatively stable around 81.5 kg to 82.5 kg, which could indicate optimal performance within their weight class. However, maintaining performance improvements at this age, especially with minimal bodyweight fluctuation, raises questions.

3. **Lift Breakdown**: The lifter showed significant increases in squat and deadlift, especially with the deadlift jumping from 205.0 kg to 237.5 kg—a notable 32.5 kg increase. The bench press remained relatively stable, which could suggest a focus on developing the other lifts.

4. **Suspicion of Drug Use**: While performance improvements can be attributed to various factors including training techniques, coaching, and nutrition, the lifter's rapid gain of over 57 kg in total lifted weight over a relatively short period, along with the absence of trends in bodyweight adjustments and age-related decline, could indicate potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Considering the data, there is a moderate chance of performance-enhancing drug use based on the rapid performance increase, the age of the lifter, and the overall context of the lifting community where such trends can often be seen.

Rating: **6/10**
