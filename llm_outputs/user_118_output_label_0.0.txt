The data shows a female lifter who has demonstrated consistent improvement in her total lifts over time. Here’s a summary of her performance:

1. **Performance Progression**:
   - On 2023-04-29, her total lift was 412.5 kg with a squat, bench press, and deadlift (S/B/D) of 145.0/87.5/180.0 kg.
   - By 2023-07-10, her total increased to 430.0 kg, with a notable improvement in all three lifts (147.5/90.0/192.5 kg).
   - In a later performance on 2024-07-20, her total reached 455.0 kg, with further increases across the board (162.5/100.0/192.5 kg).

2. **Age and Weight Considerations**:
   - The lifter is 23 years old as of her initial performance and 24.5 years old by her last recorded total, fitting within the age range where significant strength gains can occur, especially if she is relatively new to the sport.
   - Her bodyweight has also increased slightly, which might be typical as she develops strength, but must be watched relative to her performance increases.

3. **Rate of Improvement**:
   - The lifter experienced a total increase of 42.5 kg over approximately 15 months (an increase of about 2.8 kg/month), which is a reasonable rate for beginner to intermediate lifters.
   - The increase from 412.5 kg to 455.0 kg over the span also seems consistent with natural progression, yet the jumps within shorter time frames could warrant a closer look.

4. **Suspicion of Drug Use**:
   - While some increase in performance is expected, the improvements within a relatively short period (particularly from 412.5 kg to 430.0 kg) are notable.
   - However, considering her age and gradual increase, these advancements do not appear extraordinarily suspicious on their own.
   - There are no red flags indicating an extraordinary rate of improvement that would typically raise immediate concerns.

**Conclusion**: Based on her age, incremental improvements aligned with natural progression, and no extreme spikes in performance, the likelihood of her using performance-enhancing drugs appears relatively low at this time.
