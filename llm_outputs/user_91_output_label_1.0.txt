The lifter's performance shows a notable increase in total lifted weight over a relatively short time frame. On January 16, 2021, the lifter achieved a total of 522.5kg at the age of 39.5, with a bodyweight of 101.5kg. By June 26, 2021, just six months later, the lifter improved their total to 597.5kg, despite being significantly younger at 20.5 years, which raises questions regarding natural progression in performance.

This improvement of 75kg in total lifting within six months is substantial, especially considering the lifter's age change from 39.5 to 20.5, which could indicate a shift in training experience or physiological advantages. The earlier total at age 39.5 is typical for a lifter in that demographic, while the later total for a much younger lifter seems disproportionately high, especially in the squat and deadlift segments, where increases can be more pronounced.

These factors, combined with the significant leap in performance, suggest a likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs. The absence of consistent data over a longer term and the striking age variance also contribute to the suspicions.

Based on these observations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at an 8/10.
