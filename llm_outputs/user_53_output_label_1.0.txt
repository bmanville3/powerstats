The lifter's performance shows a mixed progression over the years. Starting in 2015 with a total lift of 330.0 kg, there was a notable improvement by 2016, with a peak total lift of 365.0 kg recorded in October 2019. The lifter's total consistently fluctuates, with a high of 358.5 kg in October 2018, followed by a slight decline to 302.5 kg in July 2018 before recovering to impressive totals.

Key observations include:
- **Age Factor**: The lifter is steadily aging, moving from 57 to 62 years old during this period. Typically, strength performance tends to decline with age, making the consistent improvement less typical.
- **Performance Rate**: The lifter increased their total by 25.0 kg from 2015 to 2016, followed by another increase of 10.0 kg in 2018. However, the subsequent total of 365.0 kg in 2019 represents a significant leap, raising questions about the rapidity of improvement.
- **Bodyweight**: While bodyweight has fluctuated slightly, the highest total lift (365.0 kg) occurs at a bodyweight of 71.64 kg. This suggests that the lifter has maintained or slightly increased performance while remaining within a similar weight class.
- **Consistency**: Some entries (specifically in 2015 and 2016) are duplicated, which could indicate consistent performance but may also suggest potential data entry errors or an unfair advantage.

Overall, while the lifter shows significant ability and resilience, the combination of age, performance leaps, and maintenance of high totals over time raises concerns about the likelihood of drug use. The rapid performance improvements, particularly at an age where decline is expected, suggest that further scrutiny may be warranted.

Given these considerations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a **6/10**.
