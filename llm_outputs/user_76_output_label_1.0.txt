The lifter in question has a total lift of 360.0 kg at a bodyweight of approximately 139.7 kg. Their age is 31, which positions them in the mature phase of athletic performance. Analyzing the squat, bench press, and deadlift (130.0/85.0/145.0 kg), their performance is substantial for a female competitor, especially considering the combined total.

When evaluating the lifter’s progress over time, specific benchmarks for female competitors in powerlifting reveal that their total of 360.0 kg is competitive at the national level and potentially within elite ranges, particularly in the context of their age and weight class.

However, some considerations arise when assessing the likelihood of drug use. The lifter's performance aligns with expectations for a seasoned athlete but is notable given the total weight lifted relative to their body weight. If this performance has escalated significantly in a short timeframe, particularly if they’ve increased their total lift substantially over a few competitions, it could indicate unusual progress.

Furthermore, without historical performance data, it’s difficult to establish a clear trend or rate of improvement. If they have surpassed previous records or experienced rapid gains in strength without appropriate incremental training progression, this may raise suspicions.

Given these factors, while their performance does showcase significant strength, the absence of historical data on improvements makes it challenging to conclusively label their achievements. However, the total lifted in relation to their bodyweight is impressive enough to merit scrutiny.

Overall, taking into account their performance metrics and the need for more contextual data on their lifting history, I would rate the likelihood of them using performance-enhancing drugs at 5/10.
