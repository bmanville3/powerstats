The lifter in the data has shown notable improvements over two competition dates. On October 13, 2016, they totaled 792.5 kg at a body weight of approximately 132.2 kg, while on June 3, 2017, their total increased to 837.5 kg at a slightly higher body weight of about 137.7 kg. This represents an increase of 45 kg in total lifted over about 7.5 months.

While increases in strength are typical with training, a 45 kg increase within such a brief period for a lifter already at a relatively high total (792.5 kg) raises some flags regarding the consistency of performance. The lifter's progression appears to be quite rapid, particularly given their age and the competitive nature of powerlifting, where advances typically slow as athletes approach higher totals.

Moreover, their squat, bench press, and deadlift totals are substantial, with the highest recorded event being a squat of 330 kg. This level of performance, especially at their age, is occasionally seen among elite lifters, but rapid advancement in such a short time frame can be a cause for concern.

Considering this combination of factors—rapid progression and high performance relative to age—I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10. This rating reflects significant suspicion but acknowledges that there may be natural talent or effective training strategies at play.

7/10
