The lifter in question has achieved a total of 330.0 kg at a bodyweight of 54.6 kg, resulting in a total of 6.04 times their bodyweight lifted. With a squat of 115.0 kg, a bench press of 67.5 kg, and a deadlift of 147.5 kg, this performance is quite notable for a female lifter in this weight category.

Analyzing the data, a few key points emerge:

1. **Performance Level**: Lifting over six times bodyweight is exceptional and suggests the lifter operates at a high level, which is not commonly seen in lighter weight classes, particularly among women.

2. **Rate of Improvement**: The analysis lacks historical performance data, making it difficult to assess the rate of improvement. However, if this total has increased significantly in a short time frame, it could raise red flags.

3. **Age and Sex**: At 29 years old, the lifter is in the prime of athletic performance, but the combination of their weight class, age, and performance level, particularly for a female, does suggest that further scrutiny may be warranted.

4. **Suspicion of Drug Use**: The performance metrics, particularly the relative strength (total/kg bodyweight), combined with the competitive nature of the sport, suggest potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. High-level lifting like this in a lower weight category often sees higher prevalence of PED use, especially among athletes pushing for elite rankings.

Taking these factors into account, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10.
