The data entry for this lifter indicates a total lift of 480.0 kg at just 16.5 years of age, with a bodyweight of 65.4 kg. The squat (S), bench press (B), and deadlift (D) numbers are 157.5 kg, 120.0 kg, and 202.5 kg, respectively.

Considering the lifter's age, they are already achieving competitive totals that suggest significant strength for their weight class. Typically, lifters at this age and weight would not be expected to lift such high totals unless they have an extensive background in strength training or are experiencing accelerated performance development. If we examine the individual lifts, particularly the deadlift, which exceeds three times their bodyweight, this raises some concerns.

While youth often leads to rapid gains due to adaptations to training, the rate of performance improvement and the absolute figures presented here are quite extraordinary and may imply an atypical progression. Given these factors, alongside the age and total lift performance, suspicion of performance-enhancing drug use does arise, particularly when comparing to typical benchmarks for lifters in this demographic.

Overall, taking these metrics into account, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
