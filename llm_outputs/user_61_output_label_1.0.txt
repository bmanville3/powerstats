The lifter has shown a progressive increase in total lifted weight from 590.0 kg in January 2016 to a peak of 602.5 kg in June 2017, followed by a slight decline to 580.0 kg in September 2017. The lifter is relatively young, aged 21 during the last recorded entry, and demonstrated significant progress in their squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers, particularly in the bench press where there was a notable increase from 150.0 kg to 90.0 kg, despite fluctuating body weight.

While progression in strength is common in young athletes, the discrepancies in performance, particularly in the bench press, raise questions. The lifter's performance—as indicated by their total lifts—improves by 12.5 kg over a year, but the variability in individual lifts suggests inconsistent training or potential technique issues.

Additionally, the sizeable jumps in certain lifts can sometimes be indicative of suspicious training practices, especially when considering that the lifter seems to experience both gains and a subsequent drop in total performance.

However, without more data regarding the lifter's training environment, recovery, and competition history, it is difficult to definitively conclude drug use based solely on this limited information.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 5/10. This suggests a moderate suspicion, meriting further observation but not necessarily immediate action.
