The lifter's performance demonstrates a consistent improvement over time, showcasing an increase in total lifted weight from 562.5 kg to 652.5 kg across four competitions, reflecting a total gain of 90 kg over approximately one year. This translates to an average increase of 22.5 kg per competition.

In evaluating the lifter's body weight, it appears they have gradually increased from approximately 94.1 kg to 102.2 kg. This increase in body weight aligns with their growing total lift performance, as heavier lifters can typically lift more due to greater muscle mass. However, the performance improvements are significant, especially given the relatively short time frame of just over a year.

While the progression is impressive, it is within the realm of possibility for an athlete to achieve such gains, especially in the novice to intermediate stage of training. However, factors such as the lifter's age, weight class, and percentage increase in total lifted weight should be considered. Given their performance metrics, while they do not appear to exceed existing records for their weight class, the rate of increase does raise some questions about consistency and natural progression.

Based on the weight lifted, the rapid improvement, and the overall physical metrics, there is a moderate level of suspicion regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Thus, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using drugs as a 6/10.
