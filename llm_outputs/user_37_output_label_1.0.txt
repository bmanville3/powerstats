### Performance Analysis

The lifter demonstrates a significant increase in total lifting capacity over the recorded dates.

1. **Performance Increments:**
   - From November 2016 to January 2017, their total lifted weight increased from 247.5 kg to 272.5 kg—a rise of 25 kg in just over two months.
   - Notably, from January 2017 to February 2017, the lifter's total increased dramatically by 47.5 kg to 320.0 kg.
   - The lifter maintained this upward trajectory, achieving a total of 345.0 kg in July 2017, a jump of 25 kg from February.
   - By mid-2018, the total reached 410.0 kg, culminating in an overall increase of 162.5 kg from the first recorded date.

2. **Age and Bodyweight Considerations:**
   - The lifter began competition at a young age (12.5 years) and exhibited rapid improvements in strength relative to their age and weight category.
   - While it is common for adolescent lifters to make significant gains as they grow, the magnitude and speed of this lifter's improvements are notably pronounced.

3. **Suspicion of Drug Use:**
   - Given the combination of rapid gains in total lifts, particularly in comparison to typical developmental progressions seen in youth lifters, there is a red flag. The rapid rise in performance, coupled with relatively minor increases in bodyweight, raises questions about natural growth and training practices.
   - While young athletes may experience explosive strength gains due to maturation, the scale observed here might indicate the influence of performance-enhancing substances.

### Conclusion
Considering the above factors, especially the rate of performance improvement and the total lifted weights for their age and weight class, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 8/10.
