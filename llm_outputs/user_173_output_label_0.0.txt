The lifter, a 19.5 to 20.5-year-old female, shows significant improvement in performance over a relatively short time frame. Starting with a total lift of 280.0 kg in September 2017, she increased her total to 310.0 kg by November 2017—a gain of 30 kg in just two months. By April 2018, she surpassed the 322.5 kg mark, and by July 2018, she achieved a total lift of 365.0 kg, reflecting an increase of 55 kg over a span of approximately nine months.

In terms of absolute performance, her totals of 365 kg for a body weight of 83.4 kg represent a high level of performance for women in powerlifting, particularly within her weight class. The rapid progression, especially the significant jump from 310 kg to 365 kg within eight months, raises some concerns. Typically, a steady increase is expected rather than such a substantial leap in a short period.

While rapid gains can be attributed to various factors, including effective training, nutrition, and skill development, the speed at which this lifter improved her totals might warrant closer scrutiny. Moreover, her total lifts now reflect performance levels that may be more commonly associated with experienced lifters using performance-enhancing drugs.

Given the rate of improvement and the absolute performance levels achieved, I would rate the likelihood of her using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10. This indicates a significant suspicion based on the available data, warranting further investigation.

7/10
