The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over time, with significant increases in total lifts. Starting with a total of 290.3kg on May 18, 2024, they exhibited an improvement to 320.0kg by September 21, 2024, marking an increase of 29.7kg in just four months. This rapid gain is followed by an additional increase to 337.5kg by March 15, 2025, which adds another 17.5kg over roughly six months.

Considering the lifter's age (18.5 years initially and now 19.5 years), they are still in a developing phase, where substantial increases in strength are generally expected. However, the combination of rapid performance enhancement, especially within such a short time frame, raises some concerns.

Moreover, the total lifts achieved—particularly for their weight class (bodyweight fluctuating between 45.6kg and 51.2kg)—are quite high, especially the squat (127.5kg) and deadlift (145.0kg) numbers, which are significant relative to their bodyweight. This ratio could be indicative of extraordinary performance, which when juxtaposed with the short time frame of their improvements, leads to a level of suspicion regarding potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Given these factors—rapid progression, impressive absolute performance relative to bodyweight, and the young age of the lifter—I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
