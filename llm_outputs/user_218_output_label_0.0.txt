The lifter, at age 23, has achieved a total lift of 617.5 kg, which is significant for their bodyweight of approximately 81.6 kg. The breakdown of lifts shows a squat of 210.0 kg, bench press of 155.0 kg, and deadlift of 252.5 kg.

To assess performance, we consider both absolute totals and relative progress. While the total lifts are commendable, the ratios suggest a well-balanced strength profile. However, without additional data over time (such as previous totals or historical performance trends), it is difficult to determine the rate of improvement. If this total were achieved relatively quickly (e.g., within a few months or a year of consistent training), it might raise suspicions.

In terms of absolute performance, the numbers are strong but not unprecedented in the realm of competitive powerlifting, especially for a male lifter weighing around 82 kg. However, if these lifts are significantly higher than prior performances (which are not provided), it would warrant further scrutiny.

In conclusion, based on the data at hand and the absence of a documented history of steady progression, there is some potential for suspicion regarding performance-enhancing drugs. While the lifts are impressive, the likelihood of drug use based solely on this single data entry remains moderate.
