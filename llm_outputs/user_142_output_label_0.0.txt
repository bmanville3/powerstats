Based on the data provided, the lifter, a 22.5-year-old female with a bodyweight of approximately 71.4 kg, has achieved a total lift of 320.0 kg, with individual lifts in squat, bench press, and deadlift of 105.0 kg, 72.5 kg, and 142.5 kg, respectively.

When analyzing this performance, several key points arise. Firstly, the total lift of 320.0 kg indicates significant strength for a competitor in the 71 kg weight class, especially considering the distribution of lifts. The squat and deadlift numbers stand out, with the deadlift being notably higher than typical benchmarks for athletes in this weight class.

Moreover, there are two identical entries, which does not provide a temporal perspective on performance improvement or progression over time. A lack of variance in performance data raises questions about consistency and the potential for enhanced training methods or illicit substances.

In light of these observations, while there is no definitive evidence of drug use, the lifter's performance appears to be on the higher end of the spectrum for their weight class without sufficient historical data to assess normal progression rates.

Considering all factors, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 6/10. This suggests a moderate level of suspicion based on their impressive performance relative to their bodyweight and age, compounded by the absence of diverse data points to analyze a trend of improvement.
