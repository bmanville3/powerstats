The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over time, with an overall increase in total lifts from 602.5kg in 2013 to 647.5kg in 2018, followed by a minor decline to 627.5kg in 2022. The peak performance of 647.5kg at age 26 is particularly significant, representing a substantial improvement from earlier years, especially considering the lifter's relatively stable bodyweight.

In terms of specific lifts, the increase in squat and deadlift numbers stands out. The squat performance rose from 212.5kg to 245.0kg, and the deadlift increased from 247.5kg to 272.5kg, which is a considerable leap. This kind of improvement, especially within a competitive timeframe of about five years, raises questions regarding the natural progression typically expected in powerlifting.

The lifter consistently competed in a weight class where their gains in strength appear rapid compared to averages seen in natural lifters. While it's normal for experienced lifters to see incremental improvements, the rise in totals, particularly in heavier lifts, could suggest the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), especially considering the lifter’s performance is consistently at or near the top level for their weight class.

Overall, given the exceptional performances, rapid gains, and the overall context, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
