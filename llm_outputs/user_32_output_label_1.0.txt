The lifter's performance over time shows a consistent increase in total lifted weight, especially notable from 2014 to 2016. Initial totals of 612.5 kg saw an increase to 647.5 kg by 2018, demonstrating a solid upward trajectory. However, the rate of improvement raises some questions.

- **Rate of Improvement**: From 2014 to 2016, the lifter increased their total by 35 kg over 2 years, which is reasonable. However, between 2017 and 2019, the lifter's performance plateaus at around 637.5 kg, followed by a slight decrease, suggesting potential fluctuations rather than sustained growth.

- **Bodyweight and Performance**: The lifter's bodyweight has been relatively stable, fluctuating between 91.9 kg and 101.0 kg. However, the lift totals achieved, especially with a bodyweight around 100 kg yielding a total of 637.5 kg, hint at performance levels that could be considered on the higher end for this weight class, particularly in the squat and bench press.

- **Repetition of Entries**: The presence of duplicate entries on several occasions could suggest either a clerical error or a lack of competitive variability, which may further heighten suspicion.

Overall, while the improvement rate is not excessively rapid, the consistent performance at relatively high totals, especially for the lifter's age and weight class, paired with duplicate entries, leads to a moderate concern regarding potential performance-enhancing drug use.

Rating: 6/10
