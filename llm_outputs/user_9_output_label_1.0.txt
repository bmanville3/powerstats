The lifter's performance over time shows a notable decline in total weight lifted from 590.0 kg in 2012 to 537.5 kg in 2016, despite the age increase from 50.5 to 54.5 years. This decrease suggests a potential decline in physical capability, which is expected as athletes age.

Examining the individual lifts, the squat (S), bench press (B), and deadlift (D) totals also decreased significantly over the four years. The squat dropped from 200.0 kg to 167.5 kg, the bench press from 147.5 kg to 142.5 kg, and the deadlift from 242.5 kg to 227.5 kg. This consistent drop across all lifts indicates a diminishing performance trend rather than an alarming spike, which is more common in cases of drug use.

The lifter's bodyweight increased moderately from 98.43 kg to 103.20 kg. While this slight increase could raise concerns about changes in body composition, it does not correlate with an increase in performance, further supporting the notion that the lifter is not abusing performance-enhancing drugs.

In summary, the overall performance decline consistent with increasing age and the lack of suspicious spikes in totals suggest that the lifter is likely clean. Given these factors, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 2/10.
