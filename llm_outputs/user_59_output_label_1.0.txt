### Analysis of Lifter's Performance

The lifter's progress over the recorded dates shows a significant improvement in total performance, increasing from 440.0 kg on February 5, 2023, to 480.0 kg by June 15, 2024. This represents a total increase of 40.0 kg over approximately 16 months.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **February 2023:** Total: 440.0 kg (S/B/D: 145.0/107.5/187.5)
- **November 2023:** Total: 462.5 kg (S/B/D: 152.5/107.5/202.5)
- **June 2024:** Total: 480.0 kg (S/B/D: 157.5/117.5/205.0)

The lifter has gained about 10 kg in total lift every 5-6 months, which is generally a reasonable progression in powerlifting, especially for an intermediate to advanced lifter. However, the increase in the squat and deadlift—particularly with the deadlift reaching 205.0 kg—might raise some concerns, given the short time frame and notable gains, especially in the absence of a substantial increase in bodyweight (from 70.7 kg to 72.4 kg).

**Age and Experience:**
The lifter is relatively young at 28.5 years, which can be conducive to improvements. However, the strength gains over this period, coupled with a stable bodyweight, might suggest a rapid augmentation in strength levels that could be outside typical physiological limits without assistance.

**Performance Context:**
The lifter's weighs less than 75 kg while lifting totals that approach or surpass competitive records in their weight class for natural lifters. In conjunction with the relatively rapid rate of increase in total lift performance, this raises potential concerns regarding training regimen and supplementation.

### Conclusion:
Given the substantial increases in performance over a relatively short time and the lack of bodyweight fluctuation to account for such gains, there may be grounds to question the lifter's method of training and adherence to drug-free competition standards.

I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as **7/10**.
