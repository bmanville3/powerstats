The lifter in question achieved a total lift of 492.5 kg at a bodyweight of 100.9 kg, with a notable division of lifts reported as 182.5 kg in squat, 127.5 kg in bench press, and 182.5 kg in deadlift. Given the lifter’s age of 26.5, their performance levels are impressive, particularly the deadlift and squat numbers, which are quite competitive for female lifters in this weight class.

When evaluating performance progression, it is important to consider the rate of improvement over time. However, without prior data points to establish a growth trend, we cannot definitively assess whether the lifter's performance has escalated rapidly. The absolute performance, while high, does fall within the realm of competitive powerlifting, especially for lifters who may be training at a high level or in a supportive environment.

Nonetheless, considering the bodyweight and total lifted quantity, the performance does not raise overt red flags on the surface. Female lifters in powerlifting can achieve significant totals, particularly at higher weights, due to advances in training techniques and nutrition.

Given this analysis, while the performance is impressive, it is not markedly suspicious without additional data on performance history or documented progression rates. However, the lack of transparency in training data and the potential for performance-enhancing methods are always factors in the sport.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 4/10. This indicates a moderate suspicion, primarily due to the competitive nature of the sport and the possibility of undisclosed training benefits rather than clear evidence of drug use.
