The lifter in this dataset demonstrates a progressive improvement in total weight lifted over time, increasing from 550.0 kg on August 24, 2019, to a peak of 597.5 kg on December 12, 2020. This represents a notable gain of 47.5 kg over approximately 15 months. The lifter's age and bodyweight have remained relatively stable, which is typical for experienced athletes, but the rate of increase in total lift raises some concerns.

Examining the data further, the lifter improved their total by 20 kg between August 2019 and October 2019, with another significant jump of 22.5 kg from October 2019 to November 2020. While strength gains can occur over time, especially for master's lifters, these increases are relatively rapid, particularly given the lifter's long experience and age. Additionally, the lifter's total of 597.5 kg, particularly with a body weight of approximately 91 kg, positions them significantly above average competitive standards for their age category, which could be indicative of enhanced performance.

Overall, while not definitive, the combination of rapid performance improvement and high absolute performance levels may suggest the use of performance-enhancing substances. Given these factors, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using drugs at a 7/10.
