The lifter's performance shows significant growth over time. Starting with a total lift of 430.0 kg at age 15.5, the lifter demonstrates a steady increase in their total lift, culminating in a total of 632.5 kg by age 22.5. This represents an increase of 202.5 kg in total performance over approximately 5 years, which is a remarkable progression, especially given the common physiological growth and strength gains associated with training during adolescence and early adulthood.

However, the increase in performance raises some red flags. The lifter's total lift increased by nearly 47% over this period, particularly notable given the lifter’s age and natural growth patterns associated with that age range. Additionally, the lifter achieved a 95 kg increase in total lift from 2018 to 2019 alone, which is a substantial leap in performance within a single year.

Considering these factors, including the notable absolute performance levels, particularly for the lifter's bodyweight category, there are grounds for suspicion regarding potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. While not definitively indicative of doping, the combination of rapid improvement and performance levels that are exceptionally high for natural lifters of similar age and experience warrants further scrutiny.

On a scale of 1 to 10 regarding the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use, I would rate the lifter at 8/10.
