Based on the provided data entry, the lifter achieved a total lift of 485.0 kg with a squat of 175.0 kg, bench press of 135.0 kg, and deadlift of 175.0 kg at the age of 40.5 and a bodyweight of approximately 89.35 kg.

When analyzing this performance, several factors must be considered:

1. **Age and Bodyweight**: At 40.5 years and a bodyweight of 89.35 kg, the lifter is in a competitive but challenging age range. Generally, lifters peak in their 30s, and performance can decline afterward unless they have maintained a disciplined training regimen.

2. **Total Lift**: A total of 485.0 kg in powerlifting is commendable, especially for a lifter in this age category. This suggests that they possess a high level of strength and skill, but comparative benchmarks are necessary for a more accurate analysis.

3. **Performance Rate**: Without historical performance data, it's difficult to comment on the rate of improvement. However, if this total represents a significant increase from previous records within a short time frame, it could raise suspicion.

4. **Absolute Performance**: While competitive lifters can achieve similar totals, this combined lift at their age and bodyweight may be at or above the national averages, which could indicate elite performance characteristics.

5. **Suspicion of Drug Use**: Rapid increases in performance, especially at a later age, can warrant scrutiny. However, without specific details on their lifting history or if they've shown drastic improvements in a short time frame, we can only speculate.

Taking into consideration the factors above, particularly the potential for relative performance peaks and the possibility of rapid improvement combined with age, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as moderately high.
