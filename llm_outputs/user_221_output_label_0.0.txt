The lifter in question has shown a consistent upward trajectory in performance over the observation period from 2016 to 2019. Notably, their total lift has increased from 247.5 kg to 297.5 kg, representing a growth of 50 kg over approximately 3 years. This translates to an average gain of around 16.67 kg per year.

The lifter is 64.5 years old at the start of the data and is a female competitor, which generally places them in a category where performance gains would typically be slower due to age and biological factors. The rate of improvement is substantial given their age bracket, especially as competitive lifting often sees decreasing performance with age.

Looking closely at the individual components of their lifts, significant gains can be observed in the squat, bench press, and deadlift over multiple events. For instance, the squat progressed from 67.5 kg to 100.0 kg and the bench press from 55.0 kg to 62.5 kg. Such improvements, particularly in the squat and deadlift, raise questions about the natural limits expected at this age, particularly in light of the increased total lift performance.

Moreover, the absence of any observed performance plateau or decline, especially after the notable gain from 2018 to 2019 (297.5 kg to 280.0 kg) suggests a fluctuating but ultimately high performance level, rather than a steady decline or consistent improvement.

While many factors could contribute to the lifter's performance—such as improved training techniques, enhanced coaching, or nutritional support—the rapid increase combined with the age of the lifter suggests potential concerns about performance-enhancing drug use.

Considering the age, rate of improvement, and overall performance, I would assess the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10. This rating reflects significant suspicion due to the rapid development in performance alongside the typical expectations for an athlete of this demographic.

7/10
