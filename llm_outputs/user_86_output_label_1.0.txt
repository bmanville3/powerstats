The lifter's performance shows a gradual but significant improvement over time, with total lifts increasing from 660.0 kg to 817.5 kg over a span of just over a year. This represents a rise of 157.5 kg, averaging approximately 13.1 kg of improvement per month.

Breaking down the individual lifts, the squat improved from 250.0 kg to 305.0 kg, deadlift from 247.5 kg to 307.5 kg, and the bench press from 162.5 kg to 205.0 kg. These increases also demonstrate a notable upward trend, especially in the bench press and squat, which witnessed substantial increments.

The lifter's bodyweight fluctuated, worsening slightly towards the end, which may suggest that they are working harder to increase their total lift capabilities. However, rapid performance improvements, especially in a short period, can sometimes indicate the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), especially when considering that the lifter is already at a relatively high level (105 kg bodyweight while lifting over 800 kg total).

While factors such as training regimen, experience, genetic predisposition, and nutrition can contribute to performance gains, the rate of improvement appears unusually high, particularly for a lifter of this age and weight class. Hence, the lifter raises a degree of suspicion regarding drug use due to the steep performance curve and relative dissociation from typical progression patterns observed in similar athletes.

Given the data and the rapid advancement without any apparent prior indications of lower performance, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 8/10.
