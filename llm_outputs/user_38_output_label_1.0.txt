The lifter's performance shows a significant increase over a relatively short time frame. From February 2019 to June 2019, the lifter improved their total lift from 575.0 kg to 665.0 kg, an increase of 90.0 kg, which represents a 15.65% improvement in total lift in just four months. This rate of progress is notably high, especially considering the lifter is already at an advanced competitive level.

Additionally, examining their individual lifts, the squat increased from 237.5 kg to 250.0 kg (+12.5 kg), the bench press saw a substantial rise from 102.5 kg to 165.0 kg (+62.5 kg), and the deadlift increased from 235.0 kg to 250.0 kg (+15.0 kg). The bench press improvement is particularly striking and raises red flags, as a 61% increase in such a short span is rare among competitive lifters, especially at this level.

The lifter's age of 31.5 years suggests they are in a peak range for strength, but the overall increase in performance, especially the rapid improvement in the bench press lift, seems suspicious. While improvements can occur due to training, technique refinement, or changes in nutrition, the magnitude and speed of the improvements hint at the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10, indicating a significant concern regarding potential drug use.
