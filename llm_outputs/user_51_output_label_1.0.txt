The data shows a significant improvement in the lifter's performance from December 2019 to February 2022. Specifically, the total lift increased from 345.0 kg to 387.5 kg, reflecting an increase of 42.5 kg. This represents a performance improvement of approximately 12.3% over a period of 26 months.

Analyzing the individual lifts, the squat has increased from 117.5 kg to 125.0 kg, the bench press from 80.0 kg to 102.5 kg, and the deadlift from 147.5 kg to 160.0 kg. The bench press in particular shows a notable increase of 27.5 kg, which is a significant jump for a lifter in this weight category, especially given the limited time frame and their bodyweight of roughly 56.5 kg to 58.9 kg.

Considering the lifter's age (from 19.5 to 22.5 years) and bodyweight, the performance gains are substantial but not entirely outside the realm of natural progression for a young athlete, especially as they move into their early twenties. However, the rate of improvement, particularly in the bench press, raises some concerns about the possibility of performance-enhancing drug use. The lifter's progression appears unusually rapid given the increases in both total weight lifted and individual lifts, particularly in a sport where strength gains can plateau as athletes approach their genetic potential.

Taking into account the competitive context of powerlifting, where performance-enhancing substances can be prevalent, the rapid increase in squat and bench press, combined with the overall total lift progression, suggests that there might be a reason to scrutinize this lifter closely.

Based on the analysis, I would rate the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use at a 6/10.
