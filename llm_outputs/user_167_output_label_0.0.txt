The lifter has shown a significant improvement in their performance over the analyzed period. In April 2019, they totaled 302.5 kg, with a squat of 92.5 kg, bench press of 65.0 kg, and deadlift of 145.0 kg. By January 2020, the total increased to 340.0 kg, demonstrating an impressive gain of 37.5 kg in just over eight months. This is an increase of around 12.4% in total lifted weight, which is notable, especially considering the relatively low bodyweight of 62.2 kg.

Furthermore, the substantial gains in each lift—particularly in the squat where they added 27.5 kg—raises questions about the typical progression rates for lifters at this level. While some lifters can achieve rapid improvements, such gains, especially in such a short time frame, can be indicative of enhanced training methods or potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Considering the lifter is relatively young and still within the beginner to intermediate stages of their powerlifting career, the rate of improvement may be viewed with suspicion. The combination of their increased totals, the specific weights lifted, and the time frame suggests that their performance could be on the higher end of the natural progression spectrum.

Overall, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10 due to the rapid improvement and notable total for their bodyweight category.
