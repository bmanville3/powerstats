The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over time, with incremental increases in total weight lifted across various competitions. Starting at a total of 737.5 kg in July 2018, the lifter reached a peak of 852.5 kg by April 2023, representing a significant improvement.

Key observations include:

1. **Rapid Improvement**: The lifter's total increased by 115 kg over nearly five years. While steady progress is expected, the jumps between certain competitions—most notably from 737.5 kg to 767.5 kg and then to 810.0 kg in a short span—might raise red flags, particularly since initial competitive records show lifting totals that are comparatively low for age and body weight.

2. **Consistency with Age and Bodyweight**: The lifter started at 17.5 years old with a gradual increase in performance correlating with age. However, given that they were able to surpass the 800 kg mark at only 18.5 years old, this may be considered atypical for their age category in powerlifting, which often includes lifters with more training experience.

3. **Bodyweight Considerations**: The lifter has gained a modest amount of weight while increasing totals, but the strong improvements in squat and deadlift numbers (notably a 12.5 kg increase in the squat from 805 to 817.5 kg, and similar progress in deadlift) suggest enhanced capability outside typical progression rates.

4. **Overall Totals**: A total of 852.5 kg at 145 kg bodyweight is competitive, particularly for a lifter in their early 20s. Such total weights can be indicative of advanced training and potential genetic advantage, but they can also suggest the possibility of performance-enhancing drugs, especially considering the relatively rapid ascent in totals.

Considering these observations, the lifter presents a mixed profile that shows considerable improvement but with specific patterns that could be construed as suspicious. The combination of their rapid gains, competitive totals at a young age, and relatively higher bodyweight class rankings leads to some concern over the likelihood of drug use.

Thus, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
