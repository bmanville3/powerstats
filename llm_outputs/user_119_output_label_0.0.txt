The lifter in question has demonstrated a significant increase in total lifting performance over a relatively short period. Starting from a total of 327.5 kg in October 2019, their performance has progressed to 382.5 kg by February 2021, marking an impressive gain of 55 kg in a span of just over 15 months.

Analyzing the individual lifts, the squats, bench presses, and deadlifts also show consistent improvements, indicating not just a one-off gain but a sustained increase in strength across all three lifts. The lifter has also shown progressive overload, increasing their body weight slightly while still maintaining a relatively low bodyweight for their age and gender, which could suggest an effective lifting strategy.

However, the rate of progression appears aggressive. A gain of over 16% in total lifting capacity in less than 1.5 years, especially for a female lifter aged 17.5 to 19.5, raises some suspicion. While young athletes often experience rapid improvements, the magnitude of this progression, combined with the relatively stable body weight, might indicate a use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).

Given these factors—the substantial increase in total weight lifted, the age of the lifter, and the minimal fluctuation in body weight—the likelihood of PED usage is concerning. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate this lifter's suspicion level as 7/10.
