The analysis of the lifter's performance over the two data entries shows a noticeable improvement in total lift weight. In 2013, the lifter totaled 570.0 kg at an age of 23, while in 2014, they achieved a total of 602.5 kg at an age of 24.5. This represents an increase of 32.5 kg (approximately 5.7%) in total lift over just over a year.

Breaking down their individual lifts, the squat improved from 210.0 kg to 212.5 kg (a 2.5 kg increase), the bench press from 120.0 kg to 135.0 kg (a 15 kg increase), and the deadlift from 240.0 kg to 255.0 kg (a 15 kg increase). While these improvements are commendable, the total increase is predominantly driven by significant gains in bench press and deadlift, with the squat showing minimal change.

In terms of bodyweight, the lifter also increased from 115.6 kg to 125.0 kg, suggesting a gain of roughly 9.4 kg. This bodyweight increase could potentially explain some of the increases in total lift, particularly in the deadlift category.

However, the rate of performance increase—particularly the 5.7% rise in total lift within a year alongside a bodyweight increase—could be seen as aggressive for a lifter in the 23 to 24.5 age range, especially considering the lifter has already a substantial bodyweight and lift totals.

Overall, while it is not definitive evidence of drug use, the combination of rapid performance gains and significant bodyweight increase raises some red flags. Based on these observations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
