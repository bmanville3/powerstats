### Performance Analysis

The lifter's performance from 2019 to 2024 showcases a significant upward trajectory in total lifted weight, increasing from 467.5 kg to a peak of 657.5 kg.

1. **Progression Rate**:
   - The lifter increased their total weight lifted by 190 kg over approximately 5 years. This equates to an average progression of 38 kg per year, which, while impressive, is not entirely outside the realm of possibility for a dedicated athlete, though it is on the higher end for natural progression in the sport, particularly in the less experienced age range.

2. **Training Periodization**:
   - The improvements appear consistent, with occasional plateaus (notably from 2021 to 2022, where the totals fluctuated slightly). However, a notable spike from 607.5 kg to 657.5 kg within a year raises questions about training methodologies and recovery strategies.

3. **Bodyweight Considerations**:
   - The lifter’s bodyweight fluctuated from 83.8 kg to 91.0 kg over the years. The performance-to-weight ratio remains favorable, with a total lift of approximately 7 kg per bodyweight at peak performance, which is competitive but not unprecedented in powerlifting.

4. **Age Factor**:
   - The lifter is relatively young, and while age can contribute to rapid strength gains, the rate of progress is something that raises flags. Particularly, the jump in performance at 24 years old, coupled with a stable bodyweight, suggests that the lifter is operating at a high-performance level which might exceed the typical natural gains.

5. **Suspicion of Drug Use**:
   - Considering the rapid progression, peak performance level, and age, there are indicators that warrant scrutiny. The lifter’s performance, while impressive, may align with those who use performance-enhancing drugs to achieve significant gains.

### Conclusion
Given the substantial rate of improvement, particularly in the latter part of their competitive timeline, and the level of absolute performance relative to their age and bodyweight, there is a notable level of suspicion regarding potential drug use.

**Likelihood of drug use: 7/10**
