The lifter in question shows a notable progression in performance over time, with significant increases in total weight lifted, especially between 2015 and 2019. Specifically, the lifter's total went from 620.0kg in January 2015 to a peak of 782.5kg in August 2019, an increase of 162.5kg in just over four years. This represents a largely consistent upward trajectory, albeit with some fluctuations.

Key observations:

1. **Performance Progression**: The lifter achieved totals of over 700kg multiple times, peaking at 782.5kg. While some lifters may reach such totals, the speed of improvement (from 620kg to 780kg within four years) is relatively rapid, particularly considering the age of the athlete (starting at 28.5 years old and reaching 32.5 by peak performance).

2. **Bodyweight Considerations**: The lifter's bodyweight fluctuates within a range that is typical for competitive lifters, but the increase from 113.8kg to 125.4kg while also increasing the total lift raises questions about the effectiveness of weight class management.

3. **Inconsistent Competitions**: There are notable dips (e.g., 337.5kg in March 2017) that suggest possible inconsistencies in training, injury, or other factors, but these are generally followed by significant rebounds, which can indicate either resilience or potential use of performance-enhancing substances to recover.

4. **Age Factor**: The lifter's age (with totals around 30-39 years) is typically at a point when many lifters may start to peak. The increase in total weights lifted during this age range is impressive but also triggers scrutiny regarding whether such progression is natural.

Considering the rapid performance progression, fluctuations with immediate rebounds, and the overall high totals achieved, there is a heightened level of suspicion regarding the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Given these factors, I would rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at an 8/10, indicating a high level of suspicion.

8/10
