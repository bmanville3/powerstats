The lifter's performance shows a consistent and significant progression over time, with total lifts increasing from 702.5 kg in August 2021 to 870.0 kg in May 2024. This represents an increase of 167.5 kg over less than three years, averaging approximately 4.5 kg per month.

- In terms of absolute performance, the lifter's totals and individual lifts demonstrate a high level of strength, particularly for their age and bodyweight. By May 2024, their total of 870.0 kg is reflective of elite competitive levels in powerlifting.
- The lifter's age and rapid progression raise flags typically associated with performance-enhancing drug use, especially given the considerable gains made in a relatively short timeframe. Their bodyweight has fluctuated slightly but remains within a reasonable range, suggesting that their weight class is not a factor in the observed performance gains.

Given the rapid progression and the absolute lift totals in conjunction with the age of the athlete, there is a substantial likelihood that the lifter could be using performance-enhancing drugs.

In conclusion, I would rate the likelihood of drug use as 7/10.
