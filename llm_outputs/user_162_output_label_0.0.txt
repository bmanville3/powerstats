The lifter's performance demonstrates significant progression from 2016 to 2022, with total lifts increasing from 442.5 kg to 635.0 kg over the span of six years. This is a notable improvement, particularly given the age and weight category at which they are competing.

- **Age and Weight Considerations**: The lifter started competing at a young age (17.5) and has maintained a relatively stable bodyweight (around 64.5 kg to 74.7 kg), while their total lift weight has increased substantially.

- **Performance Improvements**: The total lifted weight jumped from 442.5 kg to 555.0 kg between 2016 and 2018, showcasing an impressive gain of over 100 kg in just two years. The subsequent years show continued improvement, with two more increases beyond 600 kg reached by 2021.

- **Lifting Ratios**: The squat, bench press, and deadlift (S/B/D) have all improved consistently, with the squat reaching 232.5 kg and the deadlift peaking at 250.0 kg. The ratios of lifts to bodyweight remain competitive and indicate a balanced strength profile, but the rapid increases in strength, especially at higher total weights, can be concerning.

- **Suspicion of Drug Use**: While some lifters exhibit natural developmental growth and improvements especially in their late teens to early twenties, the rate of performance increase here appears steep, particularly from 2016-2018. Given the context of age and the frequent gains in total weight, there is a possibility of performance-enhancing drug use.

In conclusion, while natural talent, training, and dedication can explain part of the lifter's progression, the rapid improvements in performance suggest the potential for drug use. Thus, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
