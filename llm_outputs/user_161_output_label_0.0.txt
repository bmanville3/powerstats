The lifter in question has demonstrated a total lift of 385.0 kg at a bodyweight of 70.0 kg, leading to a notable performance ratio. Her squat (145.0 kg), bench press (82.5 kg), and deadlift (157.5 kg) indicate a balanced progression across the three lifts, especially when considering her age of 24.5 years.

When analyzing performance over time, it's essential to consider both the absolute total weight lifted compared to her bodyweight and the rate of improvement. While the total lift is competitive in her weight class, the figures themselves do not immediately suggest excessive performance for her age and experience level. However, should there be a lack of historical data indicating gradual progression, or if previous competition totals are significantly lower, this may raise questions regarding her training regimen and adherence to fair competition standards.

There are no explicit indicators from the data provided that suggest suspicious performance enhancement; however, without additional context on her previous lifts and normalized progression curves across a defined timeframe, it's challenging to make a definitive conclusion.

Based on the total lifted, her weight class positioning, and age, I would rate the likelihood of her using performance-enhancing drugs as moderate, assigning a score of 4/10. This suggests some caution but not overwhelming suspicion given the current data.

4/10
