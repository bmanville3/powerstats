The lifter, at just 17.5 years old, has achieved a total lift of 750.0 kg, with squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers of 340.0 kg, 155.0 kg, and 255.0 kg, respectively. These totals indicate a highly competitive level of performance for a lifter of this age and bodyweight (127.1 kg).

To assess the likelihood of drug use, we consider both the rate of improvement and the absolute performance levels. If there is historical data showing rapid gains in strength over a short period, it could raise suspicions. However, without longitudinal data up to this point, we can only evaluate the performance achieved by the lifter at a single point in time.

The absolute weights lifted are among the higher end for someone of their age and weight category, particularly in the squat and deadlift. The relative strength levels suggest potential genetic advantages or specialized training, which are not inherently indicative of drug use but do merit scrutiny.

Overall, while the performance is impressive, without clear evidence of rapid progression or prior history, it is difficult to conclusively determine drug use. Based on the available data, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a cautious 4/10.
