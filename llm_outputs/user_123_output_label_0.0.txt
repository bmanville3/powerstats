The lifter's performance shows a significant increase in both total weight lifted and individual lifts over a relatively short period. From December 2022 to March 2023, the total lifted improved by 35 kg, reflecting a 6.5% increase in just under three months.

Examining the breakdown of the lifts, the squat increased by 7.5 kg, the bench press by 7.5 kg, and the deadlift by 20 kg. These gains in individual lifts, especially the 20 kg increase in the deadlift, may raise some eyebrows, as such rapid progress is uncommon, particularly for a young lifter still in the early stages of their competitive career.

Additionally, the lifter is still quite young (15.5 years old) and only at a bodyweight of 81 kg, which suggests that they are within a natural growth phase, but their performance levels are approaching those of more seasoned competitors. Coupled with the performance relative to their age and the rapid increases, this raises some concerns.

While many factors could contribute to these gains, including optimal training, nutrition, and natural talent, the total lifted and the rate of improvement could indicate a higher likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use.

Given these considerations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 6/10.
