The lifter’s performance demonstrates a significant and consistent progression in their total weight lifted over a span of five years. Here are the key points observed in the data:

1. **Progression of Total Lift**: The total lift increased from 492.5kg in November 2017 to 620.0kg in October 2022, showing a total gain of 127.5kg. This translates to an average increase of approximately 25.5kg per year, which is a notable improvement, particularly for a lifter within this age group.

2. **Severe Increases in Specific Lifts**: The lifter's squat, bench, and deadlift (S/B/D) numbers have also shown marked improvements. For instance, the squat progressed from 180.0kg to 222.5kg, the bench from 120.0kg to 157.5kg, and the deadlift from 192.5kg to 240.0kg. Such gains are substantial, especially given that they occurred during the critical ages of late teens to early twenties, where natural growth can taper.

3. **Bodyweight and Age Factors**: While the lifter has gained some bodyweight (from 115.0kg to 120.1kg), the increases in total lift weight seem disproportionate to the increments in bodyweight. Typically, a natural lifter may see slower progress in strength relative to weight class, especially when already lifting at relatively high levels.

4. **Comparison with Peers**: When comparing this lifter's totals to averages for their bodyweight category and age group, they fall in a higher percentile. The increases over the years could raise suspicions, especially given the speed of progression.

Given these observations, the rapid improvements in performance, combined with the absolute levels of strength achieved in a relatively short span and the minimal bodyweight change, suggest the potential for performance-enhancing drug use.

Overall, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10.
