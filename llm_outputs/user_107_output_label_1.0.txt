The lifter, aged 30, has achieved a total lift of 687.5 kg, with a breakdown of 215 kg in the squat, 190 kg in the bench press, and 282.5 kg in the deadlift. Their bodyweight of approximately 89.4 kg places them in a competitive weight class.

When assessing performance, a total lift of 687.5 kg is impressive, especially considering the lifter's age and weight class. However, to evaluate the likelihood of drug use, we must consider two factors: the rate of performance increase and the absolute performance in relation to their peers.

1. **Rate of Performance**: Without historical data, it’s difficult to assess the lifter's rate of improvement. If they have made significant gains in a short period, particularly beyond the typical progression seen in natural lifters, it may raise concerns.

2. **Absolute Performance**: The totals suggest a high level of strength, especially in the deadlift, which can be indicative of enhanced training methods. However, many lifters at this weight can achieve similar totals without performance-enhancing drugs, particularly with rigorous training and proper technique.

Overall, the lifter's performance is impressive but not out of the realm of possibility for dedicated athletes, especially considering current training methodologies. Without evidence of rapid progression or unusually high totals compared to the competitive field, suspicion remains relatively low.

Based on the provided data and the analysis:
