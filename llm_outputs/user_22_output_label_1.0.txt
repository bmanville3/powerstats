Analyzing the lifter's performance data reveals several key points.

1. **Progression Over Time**:
   - From September 2014 to August 2016, the lifter increased their total lifted weight from 352.5 kg to 417.5 kg, marking a total increase of 65 kg over approximately two years.
   - The rate of performance improvement is notable, particularly considering that the lifter's bodyweight has fluctuated, but they have consistently lifted heavier weights relative to their bodyweight.

2. **Weight Classes and Performance**:
   - The lifter competes in the 72 kg weight class, yet has achieved a 417.5 kg total, which is quite competitive in this weight category, especially for a female lifter.
   - The squat, bench, and deadlift individual lifts also show significant improvements, with the deadlift reaching 175 kg and the squat 137.5 kg — remarkable figures for this weight class.

3. **Age and Physical Changes**:
   - The lifter has been in their early thirties during this data set, an age where performance can sometimes stabilize or even decline. However, this lifter has continued to improve, which could raise suspicion.

4. **Use of Performance-Enhancing Drugs**:
   - While improvements in strength are not uncommon, the rapid rate of progress, particularly given the competitive nature of the totals achieved, may indicate a concern for potential drug use.
   - A significant increase in total lifted weight (65 kg) within a short time frame is atypical without substantial changes in training or nutrition, especially given the fluctuations in body weight which could further complicate performance metrics.

Given these observations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10. Though not definitively suspicious, the rapid improvement and high performance within a relatively short timeframe in a competitive weight class raise valid concerns.
