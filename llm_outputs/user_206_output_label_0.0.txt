The lifter, at 21.5 years of age and weighing approximately 106.7 kg, has achieved a total lift of 717.5 kg, broken down into squat (265.0 kg), bench press (165.0 kg), and deadlift (287.5 kg). To assess their performance, we consider both the absolute totals and the rate of improvement.

1. **Absolute Performance**: The total of 717.5 kg, particularly for their age and bodyweight category, is quite substantial. Typically, male lifters at this body weight would be expected to achieve totals in a similar range, though the distribution across the three lifts can be indicative of training focus and natural ability.

2. **Rate of Improvement**: There is no historical data provided to assess the rate of improvement, but if this total represents a recent achievement or shows significant progression in a short time frame, it might raise suspicions. Generally, rapid increases in total lift performance, especially for athletes of this age and experience level, could indicate the use of performance-enhancing substances.

3. **Comparative Context**: The lifter's performance needs to be contextualized against norms within the sport for similar age and weight categories. If they have achieved this total much quicker than peers or shown a remarkable surge without time to adapt physically, it could signal potential drug use.

Considering the performance metrics and the implications of rapid improvement for a lifter of their age and weight category, there is a reasonable cause for concern. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 6/10, indicating moderate suspicion based on performance outcomes and potential rapid progression.
