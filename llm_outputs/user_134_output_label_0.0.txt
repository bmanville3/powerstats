The data reflects a female powerlifter's progression from February 2022 to April 2025. Over this period, her total lifting capacity increased from 332.5 kg to 415.0 kg, showcasing a steady performance improvement. The increase in total lifted weight is notable, amounting to a gain of 82.5 kg over just over three years, averaging approximately 27.5 kg per year.

Analyzing the individual lifts, her squat (S), bench press (B), and deadlift (D) also exhibit significant improvements, with a particularly pronounced increase in her deadlift from 137.5 kg to 190.0 kg. This lift represents a substantial upward trend, indicating notable strength progression.

While the increments in performance are impressive and demonstrate dedication and training, the rate of improvement raises a few red flags. The lifter's performance gains, especially in the deadlift, appear quite rapid compared to average expectations in the sport, where performance typically improves at a slower rate as athletes progress.

Additionally, the lifter's bodyweight has increased modestly alongside her performance gains, which is often a sign of healthy progression, but the substantial increase in total lifted weight compared to bodyweight can evoke suspicion.

Considering these factors—particularly the rapid rate of improvement in her total lifts and the significant deadlift gains—I would rate the likelihood of her using performance-enhancing drugs at a **7/10**. This indicates a considerable suspicion of potential doping, warranting further investigation.
