The lifter in question has achieved a total of 525.0 kg at a bodyweight of approximately 53.35 kg, resulting in an impressive total relative to their weight class. The squat (172.5 kg), bench press (135.0 kg), and deadlift (217.5 kg) numbers indicate a well-rounded performance, particularly for a lifter with a bodyweight of under 54 kg. At 17.5 years of age, the lifter’s total is significantly high for their weight class, especially for someone just entering their late teens.

In assessing the rate of performance improvement, one must consider their training history, competition experience, and any previous totals. If this total represents a marked improvement from prior competitions, or if such a high total has been achieved in a short time frame, it raises questions about the natural progression typical for lifters of this age and weight.

The combination of youth, high performance, and the relative size of their total suggests a potential for either exceptional natural ability or possibly the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Given the rarity of such totals in this demographic without prior extensive competitive lifting experience, there is a heightened suspicion regarding doping.

Based on these considerations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 7/10.
