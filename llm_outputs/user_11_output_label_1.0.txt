The lifter's performance shows notable fluctuations and improvements across the given data entries. Initially, at age 17.5, the lifter managed a total of 752.5 kg with a body weight of approximately 114.2 kg. As they progressed to age 18.5 (2017), they achieved a peak total of 795.0 kg with a decreased body weight of 103 kg. However, a significant drop in performance is noted in early 2018, where the total lifted decreased to 715.0 kg, still at a lower body weight of 93 kg.

The consistent increase in performance from 752.5 kg to 795.0 kg within a short timeframe is notable. Given their young age and rapid improvement, alongside the relatively high totals lifted, there might be a concern for potential performance-enhancing drug use, especially considering their body weight decrease coinciding with strength increases.

While the overall totals are impressive, the drop in performance in early 2018 may indicate natural fluctuations in training, recovery, or other factors. However, the lifter's progress prior to this drop raises a flag for scrutiny.

Considering the performance metrics and rapid improvements, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 7/10.
