The lifter in question has shown consistent performance improvements over the period analyzed. Starting in 2013 with a total lift of 620.0 kg, they increased their total to 652.5 kg by 2016, a growth of 32.5 kg over approximately three years. This represents a roughly 5% increase in total lift, which is moderate but not uncommon in powerlifting.

However, the data reveals an interesting pattern in the individual lifts. There was a notable jump from 620.0 kg to 640.0 kg within just over a year, which is a 3.2% increase. The lifter also increased their squat and deadlift numbers significantly, with the deadlift reaching 255.0 kg by 2016—a lift that is notable for someone in the 98-100 kg weight class.

Considering the lifter's age (between 46 and 49.5 during this time), the rate of improvement and absolute performance raises some flags. Typically, lifters at this age range experience diminishing returns on strength gains, so the relative increase observed here could be viewed as suspicious.

While the improvements fall within the realm of possibility, the combination of consistent performance increases alongside the lifter's age leads to a suspicion about the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Based on the analysis of performance trends and the lifter’s age, I would rate the likelihood of drug use as a 6/10. This indicates a moderate level of suspicion, warranting closer examination.
