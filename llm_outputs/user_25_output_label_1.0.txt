The lifter in question, aged 17.5, has achieved a total lift of 652.5 kg, comprised of a squat of 235.0 kg, bench press of 167.5 kg, and deadlift of 250.0 kg. At a bodyweight of approximately 101.8 kg, these totals indicate competitive performance levels, particularly given their young age.

A few key points stand out in the analysis:

1. **Performance Metrics**: The total lift of 652.5 kg places the lifter in a strong competitive category for their age and weight class. The individual lifts are also impressive, with a deadlift nearing the upper echelon for lifters in this class.

2. **Age and Development**: At 17.5 years, the lifter is still in a significant growth phase, which typically corresponds with rapid increases in strength. However, the absolute values presented, especially in deadlift and squat, suggest they are performing at a level that could raise concerns about the rate of improvement, especially if these values were achieved in a relatively short training timeframe.

3. **Rate of Improvement**: If this lifter has demonstrated considerable gains over a brief period, it could indicate the use of performance-enhancing substances. Young athletes can experience large jumps in performance due to natural growth and training adaptations, but extreme cases should be monitored more closely.

4. **Comparative Performance**: While the lifts are notable, they are not entirely unprecedented for an athlete of this age and weight class, but they do raise some eyebrows when considering the context of other lifters with similar stats.

Taking these factors into account, the performance is impressive but not explicitly indicative of drug use on its own. However, the potential for rapid improvements and high absolute performance levels, particularly at a young age, warrant cautious scrutiny.

I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 6/10, indicating a moderate concern based on the context of their performance and age.
