The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over a span of about 15 months. Initially, they lifted a total of 350.0kg at a bodyweight of 71.3kg on January 20, 2018. By January 19, 2019, their total increased to 382.5kg while their bodyweight rose to 77.9kg. This represents a gain of 32.5kg in total lifted, alongside a 6.6kg increase in bodyweight. Further progression is evident by April 13, 2019, with a total of 387.5kg and bodyweight at 79.0kg, adding another 5kg to their total while weighing slightly more.

The lifter's progression from 350kg to 387.5kg represents an increase of 37.5kg over just over a year—approximately 3kg per month. This rate of improvement is noticeable, especially considering they are already performing at a competitive level for their weight class. Such rapid advancement, particularly for an athlete already competing at a high level, raises flags regarding the possibility of performance-enhancing drug use.

Additionally, the absolute performance levels, particularly the total lifted relative to their bodyweight, also warrant scrutiny. For a female lifter in the 71-79kg range, achieving totals exceeding 387.5kg is impressive but not unheard of. However, the combination of rapid gains along with performance levels that begin approaching elite competitors raises concerns.

Considering the data, the lifter exhibits significant improvements that could be indicative of potential drug use. Therefore, based on the evidence presented, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
