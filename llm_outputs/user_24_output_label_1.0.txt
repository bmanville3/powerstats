The lifter showed significant improvement over a span of four years from late 2018 to late 2022. Starting with a total lift of 525.0 kg at age 16.5 and progressing to 630.0 kg by age 20.5, this athlete increased their total by 105 kg, which is a substantial gain.

Analyzing the individual lifts, the squat improved from 182.5 kg to 227.5 kg, the bench press from 137.5 kg to 175.0 kg, and the deadlift from 205.0 kg to 227.5 kg. This consistent advancement in each lift indicates a well-rounded improvement. However, the overall performance jumps—particularly the 52.5 kg increase from 2020 to 2021 and 2.5 kg from 2021 to 2022—may raise concerns about the rate of improvement, especially considering the lifter was already achieving high weights.

Additionally, the absolute total of 630.0 kg at a bodyweight of 89.25 kg indicates a high level of competitiveness in the M90 weight class, which can be associated with increased potential for drug use, especially given the rapid gains made during a relatively short career span starting at a young age.

Considering the combination of rapid performance improvements and high absolute performance levels, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10.
