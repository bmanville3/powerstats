The data shows a clear progression in the lifter's performance over a relatively short span of time.

From December 1, 2018, to April 13, 2019, the lifter increased their total lifted weight from 322.5 kg to 350.0 kg, an improvement of 27.5 kg within approximately 4.5 months. This represents an increase of roughly 8.5% in total weight lifted, which is significant for an athlete in a competitive setting, especially at a lighter bodyweight category (58.3 kg to 60.2 kg).

Additionally, the lifter's squat, bench press, and deadlift (S/B/D) totals have also increased, suggesting not just a general improvement in strength but potentially targeted training leading to gains in all three lifts. However, the increase might be viewed as rapid, especially considering that competitive lifters often see diminishing returns as they approach their genetic potential.

Given the age of the lifter (21.5 - 22.5 years), they are still within a developmental phase, where strength can increase, but the rate observed here is notable. Given the total performance level of 350 kg, this total is competitive, and while it is not unheard of, it raises eyebrows when considering the rapidity of increases.

Taking into account these factors, particularly the rate of performance increase over a short period and the absolute performance level relative to their bodyweight, it warrants a cautious examination regarding potential use of performance-enhancing drugs.

I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 7/10, indicating a reasonably high suspicion based on the performance trends observed.
