The lifter in question has shown a consistent progression in their performance over time. Starting with a total lift of 320.0 kg on June 3, 2023, they increased their total to 357.5 kg by April 6, 2024. This represents an increase of 37.5 kg over nearly 11 months, averaging approximately 3.41 kg per month.

Examining their specific lifts, the squat (S), bench press (B), and deadlift (D) have also seen steady improvements. For instance, the lifter progressed from a squat of 120.0 kg to 132.5 kg, a bench press from 55.0 kg to 62.5 kg, and a deadlift from 145.0 kg to 155.0 kg. These increases, while commendable, can be seen as somewhat rapid given the lifter's young age and relatively low bodyweight, particularly for a female competitor.

The total lifted at 357.5 kg places them in a competitive range for their bodyweight, but not excessively high; however, the rate of improvement could raise concerns. In powerlifting, particularly at the lower weight classes, progress tends to taper as lifters get closer to their genetic potential.

While there is no definitive evidence of drug use provided in this data set, the rate of progress is notable and could warrant further investigation. The lifter is young and competing in a lighter weight class, where advancements may not be as steep compared to heavier classes.

Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 6/10. This suggests a moderate level of suspicion based on their performance trajectory and context.
