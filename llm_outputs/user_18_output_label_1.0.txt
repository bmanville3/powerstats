The data shows that the lifter has made significant improvements in their total lifted weight over time. Starting from 620.0 kg in March 2016, they progressed to a peak of 755.0 kg in April 2019, representing a total increase of 135.0 kg over three years. This improvement is notable, especially considering the lifter began lifting at a relatively young age (23.5 years) and continued to develop their capacity into their late twenties.

However, the most concerning entry is from September 2023, where the total dropped to 455.0 kg at an age of 16.5 years and a bodyweight of 93.4 kg. This drastic decline in performance raises questions, particularly as it is unusual for an athlete to experience such a significant decrease in total lifted weight after having previously shown consistent improvement.

The lifter's progression from 620.0 kg to 755.0 kg is impressive, and the performance increase of roughly 21.7% in three years is relatively steep but not unheard of in young talent. Nevertheless, the drastic drop in 2023, combined with the rapid rise in their earlier years, might suggest the possibility of performance-enhancing drug use to accelerate their gains initially and potential side effects or issues leading to a sudden decline.

Overall, due to the rapid progression, substantial improvement in a short time, and the significant subsequent drop in performance, I would assess the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a level of 7/10.
