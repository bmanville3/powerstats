The lifter's performance data shows a significant upward trend in total weight lifted over time. Starting from 187.5 kg in 2013, the lifter has progressed to a peak of 680.0 kg in 2017. This represents an increase of approximately 362.5 kg over four years, which is an impressive, if not rapid, progression in strength.

Analyzing the individual lifts, we observe consistent improvements across squat (S), bench (B), and deadlift (D) performances. There is a particularly notable increase in the total lift from 622.5 kg to 680.0 kg in just six months between 2017's February and October competitions. This sharp increase, combined with the lifter's age (now 54.5 years), raises questions about the natural progression of strength. Given the typical physical constraints associated with aging, such a rapid increase might suggest the possible use of performance-enhancing substances.

Looking at the absolute performance, the total lifts exceeding 600 kg, especially in the 50+ age category, are quite high, considering the age and bodyweight of the lifter. Most lifters in this category tend to see diminishing returns as they age, making these numbers slightly suspicious.

Given the rapid gains, the high total lifts relative to age and common performance curves, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at 7/10.
