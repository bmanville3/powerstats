The lifter in question has shown a marked improvement in performance over the observed period. From June 2022 to March 2024, they increased their total lift from 772.0 kg to 812.5 kg, which is a gain of 40.5 kg over approximately 21 months. This equates to roughly 1.93 kg per month, a notable increase, especially considering they are already lifting at a high level.

Analyzing the specific lifts, the squats (S) decreased slightly from 305.0 kg to 300.0 kg, while the bench press (B) improved significantly from 185.0 kg to 195.0 kg, and the deadlift (D) showed substantial progress from 282.0 kg to 317.5 kg. The largest jump in performance is the deadlift, with a 35.5 kg increase, which could raise some concerns given the relatively young age of the lifter and their bodyweight increase from 106 kg to approximately 109.7 kg.

The rate of progression, especially in the deadlift, is notably rapid for a lifter of this age and bodyweight, which might suggest potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. However, without additional context on training regimen, nutrition, or other factors, it's difficult to definitively attribute these improvements to drug use alone.

Given the combination of age, bodyweight, and the rate of performance improvement, I would assign a likelihood rating of 7/10 for potential drug use. This suggests a significant concern but not an absolute certainty.
