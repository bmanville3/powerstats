### Performance Analysis

The lifter's performance shows a notable progression over time, with total lifting weights increasing from 305.0 kg to 387.5 kg over four competitions within a span of approximately 13 months. This represents a total increase of 82.5 kg, which averages out to about 6.35 kg per month. While improvement is expected in developing athletes, a jump from 305.0 kg to 345.0 kg within just 3 months (a 40 kg increase) followed by another substantial increase to 387.5 kg raises questions regarding the natural rate of progression, particularly for a lifter who was only 17 years old during the initial entries.

In terms of absolute performance, the lifter's totals are relatively high for their age and bodyweight. Competing in the female category with a bodyweight between 54 kg and 55 kg, these totals are at the upper end of what is seen among natural lifters in this demographic. Notably, the lifter's squat and deadlift numbers have increased significantly, with the squat moving from 110.0 kg to 147.5 kg (a 37.5 kg increase), and the deadlift from 122.5 kg to 155.0 kg (a 32.5 kg increase). Such rapid improvements, particularly in compound movements, can oftentimes be indicative of enhanced training methods or potential use of performance-enhancing substances.

Considering the lifter's rapid performance gains alongside their relatively high absolute totals for their age group and bodyweight, there are indicators that warrant suspicion regarding potential drug use.

Therefore, I rate the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as **7/10**.
