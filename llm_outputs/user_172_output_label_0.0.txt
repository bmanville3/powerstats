The lifter's performance shows a consistent improvement in total lifts over time, with a noticeable increase in strength relative to bodyweight. Starting from a total of 312.5 kg in November 2019, they progressed to a total of 342.5 kg by April 2021, representing a total gain of 30 kg within a span of 17 months. This translates to an average increase of approximately 1.76 kg per month.

The increase is complemented by a slight decrease in bodyweight, particularly evident from 62.0 kg to about 56.1 kg while still increasing total performance. Such a combination of increasing strength alongside decreasing bodyweight can be indicative of effective training strategies, but it may also raise questions about the lifter's approach to weight management and supplementation.

Moreover, the totals achieved are competitive for a female lifter in this weight class, especially given the age range and the relatively short time frame for such improvements. A peak total of 342.5 kg at a body weight of 56.1 kg suggests that the lifter is approaching high-level performance metrics, which can be atypical for natural athletes in this weight category.

Considering the rate of improvement and the competitive totals alongside the bodyweight loss and performance gain ratio, there exists a potential for suspicion regarding drug use. However, since there are no extraordinary jumps in totals within a single competition or a drastic body composition alteration in a very short time, the evidence is not definitive.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a 5/10. This indicates a moderate suspicion, warranting monitoring but not definitive conclusions without further evidence.
