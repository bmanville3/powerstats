The lifter's performance shows a significant upward trend in total weight lifted, progressing from 325.0 kg in April 2021 to a peak of 427.5 kg in July 2024. The improvements in total lift weight are notable, with increments of 7.5 kg, 22.5 kg, 22.5 kg, 30.0 kg, and 2.5 kg across the recorded dates.

While the lifter's age and bodyweight fluctuated, their ability to keep increasing total lift weight—achieving a jump of nearly 100 kg over just over three years—could raise some concerns. Moreover, the weight classes in competitive powerlifting typically allow for a maximum increase of around 2.5 kg to 5 kg every few months for natural athletes, especially in lighter weight classes.

Another aspect to consider is the relative performance against their bodyweight. As a female lifter in the 62 kg to 66 kg range, a total lift of 427.5 kg is exceptionally high, suggesting potential for enhanced performance beyond natural limits, particularly considering the aggressive increase in total over a short period.

Overall, while the data shows consistent improvement, the rapidity and magnitude of performance gains, alongside maintaining competitive body weight, could suggest the possibility of performance-enhancing drug use.

On a scale from 1 to 10, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs at a 7/10.
