The lifter's performance demonstrates a notable progression over time, with consistent improvements in total weight lifted.

1. **Performance Progression**:
   - The lifter started at 475.0 kg in July 2021 and steadily increased their total to 662.5 kg by January 2024. This represents an increase of 187.5 kg over approximately 30 months.
   - The most rapid improvements occurred between July 2021 (475.0 kg) and December 2021 (555.0 kg), where the lifter added 80 kg in just five months. Subsequent increases were more gradual, though still significant.

2. **Age and Bodyweight Considerations**:
   - The lifter was 19.5 years old at the start and has shown continued growth, suggesting natural physiological development. However, the increases in performance relative to age and bodyweight raise questions about the sustainability of the progression.

3. **Absolute Performance Levels**:
   - By age 22.5, the lifter's total weight of 662.5 kg is quite high for a male lifter weighing around 89 kg, especially given their starting numbers and the rate of improvement seen in the earlier months.

4. **Rate of Improvement**:
   - The initial increase of 80 kg in five months is a red flag, as such rapid advancements in strength, particularly in raw powerlifting, are not typical without extensive training experience or external assistance. The lifter has subsequently made further substantial gains, which may suggest a pattern of accelerated improvement.

Considering these factors, the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs is significant. On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is very unlikely and 10 is almost certain, I would assess the likelihood at **8/10**.
