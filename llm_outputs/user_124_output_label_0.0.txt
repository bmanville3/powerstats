The lifter demonstrates a clear trajectory of improvement over time, with consistent increases in total weight lifted. Starting from 302.5kg in November 2019 and reaching a peak of 478.0kg by April 2023, this indicates a total increase of 175.5kg over approximately 3.5 years. The progress seems particularly fast considering the lifter's relatively low bodyweight and the fact that they started lifting at a young age (20 years old).

Notably, their total lifted has escalated rapidly, especially from 2020 to 2022, where they moved from 347.5kg to 445.0kg in just over two years—a jump of nearly 100kg. This kind of growth at this level of competition is uncommon, particularly for a lifter with a sub-60kg bodyweight. The lifter's best lifts in squat (157.5kg), bench (87.5kg), and deadlift (233.0kg) also reflect a high level of proficiency that seems disproportionate to their weight class.

Considering these factors—the rapid gains, high absolute performance relative to bodyweight, and the age at which they are achieving these levels of performance—there is a cause for concern regarding the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. While no definitive proof of drug use can be established from performance alone, the metrics suggest a likelihood.

On a scale of 1-10 for drug use suspicion, I would rate this lifter at a 7/10.
