The lifter has shown significant improvement in their total lift weights over the recorded timeline:

1. **Performance Gains**:
   - From December 2022 (Total: 572.5 kg) to June 2023 (Total: 622.5 kg), there is an increase of 50 kg in just six months.
   - Following this, a slight reduction in total (615.0 kg) occurred in September 2023, but the lifter rebounded to a new personal best of 660.0 kg by April 2024. This marks an overall increase of 87.5 kg over approximately 16 months.

2. **Rate of Improvement**:
   - The lifter's progression from 572.5 kg to 660.0 kg represents an average increase of over 5 kg per month, which is notably rapid for an athlete of this age and experience level, especially given the relatively low bodyweight of 65.8 kg in terms of weight classes.

3. **Absolute Performance**:
   - The lifter’s current total of 660.0 kg places them at a competitive level for their age and weight class. Such performance is ambitious for a lifter with only a couple of years of training experience, especially considering their young age of 19.

4. **Suspicion of Drug Use**:
   - The combination of rapid improvements in total lift weight, alongside the high performance relative to their age and bodyweight, raises concerns about the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use. While it is possible for athletes to improve significantly, typically such an acceleration is a trend that warrants monitoring.

Considering these factors, the likelihood of the lifter using performance-enhancing drugs is rated at **8/10**.
