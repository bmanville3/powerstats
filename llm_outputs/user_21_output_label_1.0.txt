The lifter's performance shows a consistent upward trend in total weight lifted from 477.5 kg in December 2014 to a peak of 567.5 kg in August 2017, indicating significant improvement over a relatively short span of time (around 3 years). The increase of 90 kg in total lift is substantial, especially considering that the lifter had not broken the 500 kg mark until mid-2015, and subsequently achieved a remarkable 75 kg increase in just two years.

Moreover, the lifter's bodyweight fluctuated slightly above the 73 kg range, peaking at 82.5 kg in 2017, which correlates with the performance improvements. This rise in bodyweight could imply changes in muscle mass, although it is also notable that the lifter managed improvements in both strength and bodyweight concurrently.

The significant jump in total weight lifted, particularly between late 2015 and 2017, raises questions about the rate of improvement. In competitive powerlifting, such rapid progress can indicate potential drug use, especially as the lifter ages from 23 to 26—an age where natural gains typically start to plateau for many athletes.

Comparing the total weights lifted to typical performance levels in the 74 kg weight class, the lifter’s peak total of 567.5 kg is competitive at high national or low international levels, suggesting an exceptional capability. This level of performance combined with the rapid increase points to the possibility of using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).

In summary, while the lifter has demonstrated significant dedication and improvement, the rate of increase and level of performance combined with potential age-related limits raises concerns about the likelihood of drug use.
