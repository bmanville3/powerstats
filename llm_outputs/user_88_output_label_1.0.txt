The lifter in question shows a significant progression in performance over a relatively short timeframe. Starting with a total lift of 662.5 kg on January 20, 2018, the lifter increased their total to 705.0 kg by July 21, 2018, and further improved to 732.5 kg by December 8, 2018. This represents an increase of 42.5 kg in just six months, followed by an additional rise of 27.5 kg over the next five months. In total, they gained 70 kg over approximately eleven months.

In terms of rate of performance improvement, the lifter's increases—particularly in the context of their age (21.5 years) and bodyweight (hovering around 87-92 kg)—are noteworthy, although not entirely unprecedented in the sport of powerlifting. The combined squat, bench press, and deadlift totals reflect a high level of strength, with the deadlift portion being particularly impressive at 300 kg, which may be seen as unusually high for someone in the 87 kg weight class.

While many factors contribute to an athlete's performance, such as training regimens, genetics, and nutrition, the rapid improvement coupled with relatively high absolute totals raises potential concerns regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Given these observations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using drugs as a 7/10. This rating suggests a significant level of suspicion, warranting further investigation despite not being conclusive.
