The lifter in question, competing at the age of 30, has achieved a total lift of 397.5 kg (with breakdowns of 137.5 kg squat, 92.5 kg bench press, and 167.5 kg deadlift) at a bodyweight of approximately 72.3 kg. Evaluating their total lift in relation to their bodyweight yields a strong power-to-weight ratio, as this total is significantly above average for their weight class.

Observing the raw totals and individual lifts, they showcase impressive strength levels that could suggest advanced training and dedication over time. However, without historical data for comparison, it’s challenging to conclude if their performance progression appears unusually rapid.

Nonetheless, the total kilogram lift, combined with the lifter’s relatively low body weight, raises red flags in terms of performance enhancement. The significant lift totals, especially in a competitive environment, warrant concern about potential drug use, as such performance levels might be difficult to achieve naturally without an extended training history.

Based on these observations, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as 7/10.
