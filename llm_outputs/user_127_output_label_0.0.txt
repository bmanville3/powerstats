The lifter's performance shows a significant increase in total weight lifted over a relatively short period. Starting from a total of 235.0 kg in August 2017, the lifter progressed to 390.0 kg by June 2019. This represents an increase of 155.0 kg, or approximately 66%, within less than two years, which is remarkable for any athlete, especially in powerlifting.

Breaking down the individual lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift), it can be seen that the lifts increased steadily, with particularly large jumps noted in both the squat (from 90.0 kg to 152.5 kg) and deadlift (from 80.0 kg to 150.0 kg). The total increase in performance is quite rapid, particularly given the lifter's bodyweight, which has only increased slightly over the same period.

Considering the age of the lifter (24.5 to 26.5 years) and their sex (female), one would expect improvements, especially with training; however, the rate of improvement appears excessive when comparing the total kg lifted alongside the small increase in bodyweight.

This combination of high performance increases, along with the lifter's relatively stable bodyweight, raises concerns regarding the potential use of performance-enhancing drugs. The rapid progress and current totals are atypical for the lifter's demographic without the aid of such substances.

Overall, given the evidence of significant weight gains in a short time and the lifter's demographic factors, I would rate the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use at 8/10.
