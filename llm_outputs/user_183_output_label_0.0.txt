The lifter's performance shows a consistent upward trajectory over the years. Starting with a total lift of 530.0 kg in June 2018 at the age of 20, the lifter increased their total to 580.0 kg by July 2019. This is a substantial gain of 50 kg in just over a year. They maintained this total across two records, which could indicate stability or potential manipulation of records.

By October 2020, the lifter reached a total of 602.5 kg while further decreasing bodyweight, indicating an improvement in strength-to-weight ratio. The most significant jump comes in April 2021, with a total of 637.5 kg, marking an increase of 35 kg in just six months. This rate of improvement—especially in a lifter who's already experienced significant gains—raises some concerns about the natural limits of performance enhancement.

The lifter's consistent performance increases, rapid progress within a relatively short timeframe, and the significant lift totals as a male lifter with a bodyweight below 75 kg suggest they may be pushing the boundaries of natural performance.

Given these factors, the likelihood of using performance-enhancing drugs becomes a point of concern.
