The lifter in question has a total lift of 445.0 kg at an age of 44.5 years and a bodyweight of 88.8 kg. Breaking down the lifts: Squat 142.5 kg, Bench Press 117.5 kg, and Deadlift 185.0 kg.

Given the lifter's age, their performance must be evaluated in the context of typical progression for athletes in this age bracket. Generally, lifters tend to peak in their mid-to-late 30s, and thus significant increases in total kg lifted at this age could imply either a plateau or decline in natural progression. The lifter’s total performance appears respectable but not extraordinary, suggesting a competitive, albeit natural, athlete.

However, the absolute numbers displayed are moderately high for a lifter of this age and weight class, particularly considering the squat and bench press. The combination of their performance and age raises some flags, especially if previous performance data were available to suggest an unusual rate of improvement over time.

Overall, while there are some indicators of potential use—specifically the high strength levels relative to age—I would need more context about the lifter's historical performance trends to conclude definitively. The absence of any rapid or dramatic improvements in this single entry, however, suggests that while the lifter is strong, they may not be exhibiting overt red flags for drug use.

Based on these considerations, I would rate the likelihood of performance-enhancing drug use as a 4/10.
