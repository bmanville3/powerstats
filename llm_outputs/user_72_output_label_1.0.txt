The lifter in question shows a significant progression in performance from December 2018 to March 2022. Starting with a total of 240.0 kg at 18 years old, the lifter increased their total to 350.0 kg in just over three years, representing an increase of 110.0 kg or approximately 45.8%. Their weight class also saw a gradual increase, from 67.05 kg to 75.71 kg.

Examining the individual lifts (squat, bench press, and deadlift), the lifter has improved across all three disciplines with particularly notable gains in squat and deadlift. The improvements seem consistent, especially considering they are in a lower weight class, yet the increase from 240.0 kg to 350.0 kg raises a flag due to the rapid nature of these gains.

In the context of their age and experience, these improvements are impressive, but not necessarily outlandish. Female powerlifters can reach significant totals, but the rate of progression combined with the relatively high totals raises concerns for possible performance-enhancing drug use.

Based on this analysis, I would rate the likelihood of drug use at 7/10, indicating a considerable suspicion of possible performance-enhancing drug involvement.
