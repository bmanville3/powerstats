### Performance Analysis

The lifter's performance shows a generally upward trend with fluctuations over the years. Initial performances in 2009-2010 demonstrate a gradual increase in total weight lifted, peaking at 714.4kg in 2011. After a slight decline in 2014, the lifter exhibits another increase, reaching a similar total of 710kg in 2017 and maintaining performance levels around 705-710kg until 2020.

Key observations include:

1. **Performance Progression**: The lifter has shown a notable improvement from 680kg in 2009 to 714.4kg by 2011. Thereafter, while there are fluctuations, the overall performance remains high.

2. **Age Factor**: The lifter competes in the Masters category (50+), and performance at this age is typically expected to decline or plateau. However, the lifter has managed to maintain performance levels that would be impressive even for younger competitors, suggesting potential atypical resilience or possibly enhanced recovery.

3. **Body Weight Changes**: The lifter's body weight has increased from approximately 99.8kg in 2009 to around 117.9kg in 2020, which corresponds with the total weight lifted, indicating a potential strategy of gaining weight to lift heavier. Such drastic changes can be a point of concern.

4. **Consistency with High Totals**: The lifter has numerous totals in the 680-710kg range over several years, which is particularly notable given the aging factor.

5. **Duplicated Data**: There are multiple entries for the same day (2010-03-05 and 2020-11-07), which might suggest a need for closer scrutiny regarding performance consistency or discrepancies.

### Conclusion

Given these observations, the lifter's sustained high-level performance, particularly during an aging phase and significant body weight increase, raises concerns about the likelihood of utilizing performance-enhancing drugs. While not definitive, the performance trajectory appears atypical for their age cohort.

**Likelihood Rating:** 7/10
