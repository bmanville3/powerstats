**Performance Analysis:**

The lifter demonstrates a notable progression in performance from April 2019 to July 2021. Over this period, the total weight lifted increased from 427.5 kg to 540.0 kg, representing a growth of 26.3% in just over two years. This corresponds to an average increase of approximately 56.25 kg per year.

In terms of individual lifts, the squat (S), bench (B), and deadlift (D) numbers also show significant improvements. For example, the squat increased from 142.5 kg to 175.0 kg, the bench from 102.5 kg to 135.0 kg, and the deadlift from 182.5 kg to 230.0 kg, showcasing an overall upward trend in performance across all lifts.

The lifter's rapid progression at a young age (from age 15 to 17) raises some concerns. While gains in strength are common during the adolescent growth phase, the magnitude of these improvements—totaling 112.5 kg in less than two years—may indicate a rate of advancement that could be considered suspicious, particularly in an athlete of this age group.

Additionally, the lifter's absolute performance in relation to their bodyweight (around 96.3 kg at peak) shows them lifting over 5.6 times their body weight, which is an impressive feat, although not unheard of in elite youth lifters. However, such performance levels, combined with the rapid increases, lead to further scrutiny.

Based on the analysis of performance improvement rate and absolute performance metrics, the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs is rated at **7/10**.
