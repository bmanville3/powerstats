The lifter's performance data shows a progressive increase in total weight lifted over the specified periods:

1. **2020-11-13**: Total 730.0kg
2. **2021-07-09**: Total 752.5kg (Increase of 22.5kg in approximately 8 months)
3. **2021-11-14**: Total 770.0kg (Increase of 17.5kg in about 4 months)
4. **2022-06-08**: Total 762.5kg (Decrease of 7.5kg in about 7 months)
5. **2023-04-22**: Total 755.0kg (Decrease of 7.5kg in about 10 months)

The initial progression from 730kg to 770kg in just over a year reflects a notable improvement of 40kg, which, while impressive, is not entirely uncommon in competitive powerlifting, especially for a relatively young lifter (26-29 years old). However, the subsequent dips in performance suggest fluctuations that may hint at injury, training changes, or other factors rather than continuous or linear improvement.

When examining the lifter's bodyweight, there is a notable increase from 92.5kg to 100.5kg, which could contribute to the strength gains. However, an increase of 8kg in bodyweight alongside a total lift increase of 40kg does raise questions about how much of that strength gain correlates to muscle versus potential fat gain.

The overall rate of improvement in high-level competitive totals combined with the quick increases seen initially can lead one to consider the possibility of performance-enhancing drug use. This assessment must consider not only the athlete’s results but also factors such as training environment, access to coaching, and individual genetic predispositions.

While the improvements are significant, they do not appear extraordinarily rapid or extreme when placed in the context of competitive lifting. Therefore, while there are indicators worth monitoring, the data does not conclusively suggest drug use.

Based on the analysis of performance progression, fluctuations in totals, and bodyweight changes, I would rate the likelihood of this lifter using performance-enhancing drugs as a moderate concern: **4/10**.
