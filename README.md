# Overview

This repo contains my project for CS4365/6365 Introduction to Enterprise Computing (Suâ€™2025) at Georgia Tech.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to derive a data driven algorithm to predict drug-use in raw powerlifting.

## Running Python Files

It is recommend to run all files in this [`powerstats/src/`](./src/) as a module from the `powerstats/` directory. Python's module resolver can be frustrating sometimes when you try to run something directly. Running `python src/main.py` is almost certainly going to throw errors about not finding a package. To fix this, run `python -m src.main`.

## Getting started

### The Main File
[`powerstats/src/main.py`](./src/main.py) is the main runner for this project and has a CLI explaining components of the project. Please resort to it for running all analyses (run `python -m src.main --help` from `powerstats/` for help).

### The GUI
[`powerstats/src/gui.py`](./src/gui.py) will run a GUI to input user data into. The GUI is easy to use and self documenting. Simply enter each result from a user as the fields request, select which model to use, and click the "Calculate" button. This will run the inputted data through the selected model and output a probability from 0 to 1 of the user using drugs.

Note: A date is asked to be inputted with each result, but the date itself does not matter as long as they give the correct ordering of results. That is, if Y happened before X, then it should be date(Y) is before date(X) but it does not matter exactly what date(Y) or date(X) is.

### Getting the dataset
The dataset can be found at [https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/](https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/). For more information, see [`powerstats/data/README.md`](./data/README.md). For more links, see [`powerstats/data/raw/additional_links.md`](./data/raw/additional_links.md).

### Loading the Dataset
 For information on loading the dataset, see [`powerstats/data/README.md`](./data/README.md).


### Dependencies
All dependencies have been listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt). For reproducibility, the exact versions have also been given. Please install these dependencies before continuing.

### Pre-commit Set-up

1) Pip install the requirements which will install `pre-commit`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Once `pre-commit` is installed, run the following command to configure the pre-commit hook.
```
pre-commit install
```

3) Now when typing `git commit`, `pre-commit` will run on all staged files. To run on all files in the project, run
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Results from the Models

Graphical results from the models can be found at [`powerstats/graphs/models/`](./graphs/models/). For an explanation of the results, see [`powerstats/graphs/models/README.md`](./graphs/models/README.md).
